## Trail 21: Little River

### Overview

This hike is a great introduction to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park by featuring a bit of many of the elements that make the Smokies special: a trail along a beautiful, clear river; a waterfall; abundant plant and aquatic wildlife; deep forest; and a peek into Smokies history when you step into the cabins in the Elkmont Historic District. The hike starts at the Little River trailhead, following the Little River along its namesake river. Turn around near the small waterfall or continue the loop back to the trailhead. Great for kids of all ages, because there is not any one spot you must reach on the trail. Simply hike as far as you like and then head back to picnic or check out the historic cabins!

#### Eastern Hemlock

A tree that “feels” like the Smokies - likes shaded groves. Characterized by its needles being arranged in a flat frond. Threatened by an invasive species, the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid. While many trees in the region are affected (look for a white dusty covering of needles), others are not. Look for it along this trail.

### Nearby

-   **Visit the historic cabins.** The nearby historic cabins are a must-see. Kids love to duck into and out of many recently restored (and others in the process of being restored).
-   **Camp at Elkmont campground.** The Elkmont Campground is scenic, large, and worth a visit, especially if you can reserve a spot beside the Little River.
