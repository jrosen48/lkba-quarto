## Trail 21: Little River

### Overview

This hike is a great introduction to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park by featuring a bit of many of the elements that make the Smokies special --- a trail along a beautiful, clear river; a waterfall; abundant plant and aquatic wildlife; deep forest; and human history in the form of historic cabins. It's close to many amenities, and the drive from Knoxville is doable in a day. The hike starts at the Little River trailhead, following the Little River along its namesake river. Turn around near the small waterfall or continue the loop back to the trailhead. Great for kids of all ages because there is not any one spot you must reach on the trail; hike as far as you like and then head back to the start to picnic or check out the historic cabins!

### Nearby

-   Visiting historic cabins. The nearby historic cabins are a must-see. Kids love to duck into and out of many recently restored (and others in the process of being restored).
-   Camping at Elkmont campground. The Elkmont Campground is scenic, large, and worth a visit, especially if you can reserve a spot beside the Little River.
