Picture this: A sunny day in nature with your family. Your kids happily
throw rocks in rivers and wade in creeks. Oh, look---JoJo caught a
crawdad! You enjoy a peaceful picnic with no complaints about the peanut
butter and jelly on wheat bread.

\emph{Record Scratch}

Sure, we'd all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is
a bit messier, potentially whinier (which comes with the territory when
doing activities with young kids), and comes with unexpected bumps in
the road.

In reality, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even
leave your house. Packing for a day hike seems like it should be simple,
but by the time you consider what your family will need, you've already
expended a lot of mental energy and can't muster up the patience for the
car ride to the trailhead.

Once you arrive, the kids are hungry for the forty-third time, the baby
falls and scrapes her knee and refuses to go in the carrier pack, and
your oldest can't be pulled away from the creek at the beginning of the
hike!

We've been there more times than we can count, and have felt more relief
in a hike being over than we felt excitement to go on the hike in the
first place. However, we've also grown as a family who hikes, honed in
on the process, adjusted our expectations, and have built some beautiful
memories in the process.

\begin{figure}[H]

If you're a family who enjoys the outdoors, wants to enjoy the outdoors,
and wants to learn more about the hiking, read on!

\subsection{Why we wrote this book}\label{why-we-wrote-this-book}

When we moved to Knoxville with a three-month-old, we struggled to find
our place in a new city. Our first trip to Ijams felt like a turning
point, introducing us to Knoxville's incredible outdoor spaces. A
camping trip to Frozen Head State Park opened our eyes: this place is
special! Later, our first trip to the Smokies sealed the deal: we loved
it here.

Hiking can be a way to get to know a place, each other, and oneself. It
doesn't have to cost much (or anything!). And it can be fun.

As we transitioned from newcomers to those welcoming new friends, we
were increasingly asked a question:

\emph{Where should we go to hike?}

This book is meant to be our answer -- for our friends and for you!

This book reflects our journey of hiking with children from infancy to
early elementary school, and we've designed it to grow with your family.

Thus, we are sensitive to how what counts as a family-friendly hike is
likely different at different times -- and what we consider to be
family-friendly differs (even between us as co-authors; cough cough,
Josh!).

\subsection{Who this book is for}\label{who-this-book-is-for}

We worked hard to be laser focused on that task. Several great books on
hiking in Knoxville or its surroundings exist (we detail some of our
favorites in Chapter XX). This book is for families and others caring
for children who are looking for an accessible introduction to the
outdoors that spares no excitement.

For these reasons, we included a wide range of hikes, from those shorter
than a mile on paved trails to epic expeditions into the Smokies.
Additionally, we've noted trails that are stroller-friendly or
accessible for families with additional needs.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{img/ayla-flowers.jpg}}

}

\caption{Photo credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg}

\end{figure}%

We focus on the joy and challenges of hiking with little ones--from
babies up through what we call ``big kids'', those who can confidently
navigate terrain and lengthy hikes on their own.

\subsection{Where the hikes are}\label{where-the-hikes-are}

All of the hikes are near Knoxville, from just a few minutes to within
an hour or two drive (but no longer). In accordance with our focus on
hiking with younger children, most of the hikes are within an hour's
drive of Knoxville. We categorize the hikes into three regions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{In and around Knoxville}: Hikes within the Knoxville city
  limits, to those within a 30-minute drive.
\item
  \textbf{The Cumberland Plateau}: An often under-appreciated but
  fantastic region of rock outcroppings and wild rivers to the West and
  North of Knoxville. The hikes in this book are from around one to two
  hours from Knoxville, with most being close to one hour.
\item
  \textbf{The Great Smoky Mountains National Park}: The most-visited and
  the most biodiverse national park---right in Knoxville's backyard.
  These are mostly around an hour from Knoxville, though a few are
  closer to two hours.
\end{itemize}

In the next chapter, we'll provide some pointers on how to prepare for
your first hike.

\part{Introduction}

This section introduces the book -- what it's about and how to use it,
as well as some tips on getting started.

\chapter{Considerations for Your First
Hike}\label{considerations-for-your-first-hike}

\subsection{You don't need fancy gear!}\label{you-dont-need-fancy-gear}

You might have the impression that you need fancy gear and lots of
training to hike. Not so!

Our view is that you don't need anything special to enjoy your first
hike. With the right trail and a few basics, you'll be ready for an
adventure. Choose the right hike at the right time, and you may not need
much gear at all. We detail those considerations: selecting a particular
hike at a particular time and a few other things that are needed on
practically every hike.

\subsection{Define your own adventure}\label{define-your-own-adventure}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{img/ruth-hill.jpg}}

}

\caption{Photo Credit to Sam Weisbrod}

\end{figure}%

Do you need a hike that will help burn older kids' energy? Or do you
have toddlers who simply want to touch every leaf and rock you pass?
Decide what's most important for your family hike and pick a trail that
best supports that! For example, if you're looking to burn energy, try a
trail with some elevation. On the other hand, for toddlers, a short,
flat path with creeks or flowers can spark their curiosity.

\subsection{Let kids take the lead}\label{let-kids-take-the-lead}

To help your kids develop a love for hiking and the outdoors, let them
take the lead. Let them develop their own interests and explore their
own curiosities when you go on a hike. Sometimes this might mean playing
in a creek for half of your planned hiking time.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{img/kidslooking.jpg}}

}

\caption{Photo credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Plan for a mess}\label{plan-for-a-mess}

When a kiddo plods through a creek, it sure is nice to have a backup
pair of socks and shoes! Sometimes, a change of clothes packed in your
bag or in your car can come in handy. Pack a small bag (grocery bags can
work!) for muddy clothes and wet or dirt shoes and a small towel for
quick clean-ups

\subsection{Plan for the basics}\label{plan-for-the-basics}

Take a look at the weather for the area or region you're hiking, get a
gauge on the terrain, and wear or pack appropriate clothes and shoes.

Here is a list of just the most basic items to consider bringing:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Water (often more than you think you'll need)!
\item
  A waist pack or backpack to put all of this in
\item
  This book or another map can be helpful; it's best to not count on
  having phone signal on most trails
\item
  Change of clothes---especially socks!---for wet trails
\item
  And don't forget snacks---lots of snacks!
\end{itemize}

Kids may like to carry some of these!

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{img/jo levi backpack.jpg}}

}

\caption{Photo credit to Sam Weisbrod}

\end{figure}%

In addition to the basics, there are of course some optional items to
consider. We've detailed these in Appendix XXX.

\subsection{Consider the weather!}\label{consider-the-weather}

We can be choosy as local hikers.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{img/trees-with-light.jpeg}}

}

\caption{Photo credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Embrace serendipity}\label{embrace-serendipity}

It's good to have a plan, but don't be surprised if something better
comes along! Maybe you hike further than you thought you would, or
perhaps your child surprises you (and themselves!) by taking some time
to rock hop across a creek, follow animal tracks, or look at plants and
flowers. Be ready to follow your child's lead---whether that means
stopping to watch a butterfly or counting animal tracks. These moments
often become the most cherished.

\subsection{Select advice}\label{select-advice}

We asked some local hiking experts to share some additional advice.
Here's what they said:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Kids need to find things they love on hiking.'' - Finn (3)
\item
  ``Find rocks while hiking.'' - Ruth (5)
\item
  ``When possible, swim in the waterfalls.'' - Ruth (5)
\item
  ``It's important to go off the trail.'' - Ruth (5)
\item
  ``If your baby can walk a little bit, then let them walk.'' - Jonah
  (age 6)
\item
  ``Make sure to run and also look for bears.'' - Levi (7)
\item
  ``You might want to bring pants and a sweatshirt with a hood. Because
  that one time I brought no pants and a sweatshirt with no hood.'' -
  G.H. (9)
\end{itemize}

We have a few other key details that are important, but are not
essential for your first hike---additional gear, first aid kit
essentials, and principles for being a good steward of the trails and
outdoors. We've included those in the Appendix.

The next chapter offers some guidance on how to pick a trail (and how to
use this book).

\chapter{Finding a Hike}\label{finding-a-hike}

You don't need to pick \emph{the absolute best} trail for little ones to
have a great time. Instead, you need one that works for your family!

In our experience, it can be really hard to predict when and where we'll
have a great time.

Sometimes we have picked out a popular hike, but ended up disappointed
by crowds and congested trails. Yet, at other times, we have picked out
a trail near downtown Knoxville and a whim and have been delighted.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{img/kidscrossingcreek.jpg}}

}

\caption{Photo credit to Sam Weisbord}

\end{figure}%

Thus, we think the hike is the where your family has the best
experiences. Parents and caregivers know how this works in other places
and at other times: kids receive a holiday gift, and they end up playing
in the cardboard boxes.

The same is true for hiking! The best family-friendly hike is the one
where your family feels connected and creates lasting memories---whether
it's a scenic overlook or a creek where your kids throw rocks for hours.

That said, the hikes in this book are those on which we have had good
experiences. We think those in this book offer great ``bang for your
buck''. While some of them are very popular, others are far less
well-known. We selected the hikes that are in the sweet spot for parents
of younger children: not too far away, not so challenging so as to be
discouraging to kids and their parents; near amenities; and being
scenic, appropriately challenging, and rewarding.

\subsection{Finding the best hike for your
family}\label{finding-the-best-hike-for-your-family}

Some trails are short, flat, and on a paved surface. Others are longer,
steeper, or rockier. How do you find which one is best for yoy?

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{img/rocky trail.jpg}}

}

\caption{Photo credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg}

\end{figure}%

This book is organized into the three regions we mentioned in the last
chapter -- in and around Knoxville, the Cumberland Plateau, and the
Great Smoky Mountains National park.

Within each section, we ordered the trails loosely along the lines of
those we'd recommend first to friends looking for a pointer for where to
go. Thus, the first few hikes in each section are what we think of as
sure bets --- get the weather right, pack a bunch of snacks, and we
think you'll likely have a good time.

For example, Seven Islands in Knoxville is a reliable choice with paved
paths, beautiful views, and plenty of spots for kids to explore. The
other hikes are also great but may be more challenging or some care with
respect to timing to avoid crowds.

\subsection{Hiking one of the trails in this
book}\label{hiking-one-of-the-trails-in-this-book}

Each trail in this book includes an overview and the approximate driving
distance from Knoxville, the length of the hike, and for which ages the
hike is best. Check those out to find one that's best for you.

Additionally, the chapters include a trail description, directions to
the trailhead. We also include a map of the trail, and a note about
what's nearby. The trails also include one or more ``callouts'' to
scientific, historical, or other interesting information about the
trail. Pick one or a few and head out!

If you're looking for some inspiration, we have created top five lists
for different features of trails in the Top 5 Hikes chapter (and the end
of this book).

The trail maps should be pretty straightforward to use; the trailheads
are marked with a green dot, and the trail is in red, with key features
of the trail noted along the way. There are symbols for parking areas,
restrooms, scenic overlooks, waterfalls, and other amenities, like
playgrounds and picnic areas.

\subsection{Let's go!}\label{lets-go}

You're ready for your first hike!

\part{Knoxville and its Surroundings}

These hikes are within or near Knoxville, in what is often referred to
as the Tennessee Valley. The Tennessee Valley includes Knoxville and
many other cities that border the mountains that surround Knoxville.
This area is known as the Tennessee Valley because of its primary
geographic feature: The Tennessee River.

The Tennessee River begins just beyond the city limits of Knoxville,
where the Holston and the French Broad Rivers meet. It (literally and
figuratively!) contains fewer high points than the Cumberland Plateau
and the Great Smoky Mountains, but, it should not be discounted as a
destination for hiking.

We think a trip to Seven Islands State Birding Park will make how
spectactular this area can be evident. Around 30 minutes away from most
places in Knoxville, this is a true destination for not only birders,
but also hikers and paddlers.

Other locations are also not only close, but (surprisingly) worthy of a
trip. Ijams on the south side of Knoxville--familiar to many in the
Knoxville area--has many spectacular features, in addition to being
fewer than ten minutes away from downtown.

Other places that we highlight are also worth your time, offering an
outdoors respite in addition to the ability to easily be integrated into
busy schedules and other commitments. If you are looking for a first
family hike, those in this section may make a great selection.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{maps/Knoxville_Region_v1.jpg}}

\chapter{Trail 1: Seven Islands}\label{trail-1-seven-islands}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}

This is one of our favorite trails in this book, and it is the first
trail for that reason! This hike is a crowd pleaser for every family
member of all ages thanks to a paved path that makes bringing babies in
a stroller a breeze and easy acces to experience meadow, woodland, and a
river! For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a
meadow. Look for varied bird varieties and deer in all seasons! The
trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and then a dirt trail
make a loop around a beautiful island before returning back to the paved
path. This hike is great for all ages and seasons, though it is
sometimes hot in the summer due to limited shade on the paved part of
the trail.

While many birds stop over at Seven Islands and areas like that on their
migratory routes south (in the fall) and north (in the spring), the
Eastern Bluebird is a year-round resident. Bluebirds are obligate cavity
nesters - which is why they have experienced such a decline in their
population as urban sprawl has increased. Refuges like Seven Islands
give them lots of opportunities to find natural cavities to nest in!\\

\chapter{Trail 2: Ijams Riverside}\label{trail-2-ijams-riverside}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-1}

It's easy to take this destination for granted if you live in Knoxville
-- we seem to find something new every time we visit! Bring along your
baby carrier for this hike, which is meant to be a gentle introduction
to what Ijams refers to as the Riverside area. The trail starts by the
Ijams Nature Center's visitor center and meanders down through a deep
forest to the river. It continues along the boardwalk trail that happens
to follow the side of the very first mile of the Tennessee River. The
trail returns back up and over a rocky ridge to return to the visitor
center. Ijams offers multiple play areas and links to other trails
nearby, so you can make a day of it!

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-2}

A gem in Knoxville's city park system, this hike, entirely on a paved
path, circles the perimeter of the park, featuring high points, views of
the Smokies, and a boardwalk along the river. It also boasts four
excellent play areas along the way! Well known, but not overrated, this
is a great spot for a hike that could fit into a busy weekend, or even a
weeknight, and is great for young ones of all ages, truly offering
something for everyone.

\chapter{Trail 4: High Ground Park}\label{trail-4-high-ground-park}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-3}

This is one of the closest hikes to the city center of Knoxville, and
it's stroller-friendly! This short but sweet hike is perfect as a real
but accessible outing for toddlers and little kids. The red chairs at
the top are a fun stopping point. The deep woods are pretty and offer
something new in each season. This could be a great first hike for
toddlers -- it was one of the first for our little one, and made us feel
like we could start venturing to other regional hiking destinations.

\chapter{Trail 5: UT Arboretum}\label{trail-5-ut-arboretum}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-4}

This is a gem of a hikie that is off the radar for many in Knoxville, as
it is tucked away in nearby Oak Ridge. Start your hike at a trailhead
that offers many hiking options. We recommend walking up the paved path
past botanical specimens, including uniuque conifers! Circle around park
facilities past a pretty field and forests. Upon returning to the start,
there are other trails to the different ecological zones represented in
an area that is worth a visit; we like the trails near the marshy area
with the clear creek, perfect for splashing in warm weather. Suitable
for kids of all ages.

\chapter{Trail 6: Knox-Blount
Greenway}\label{trail-6-knox-blount-greenway}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-5}

Another hike that is very close to Knoxville's city center, the
Knox-Blount Greenway, is a fun, easier outing for little walkers,
bikers, and for parents pushing little ones in strollers. Paved
throughout, this trail offers a glimpse of the surprising beauty of the
Tennessee River so close to the city. Our description features a route
that heads to the north, toward the city, and then back to the trail
from the research park further south, before returning to the start.
Look for blue herons and other birds along the side of the river; you
might see a Bald Eagle! While beautiful, there is limited shade here, so
factor the weather in before setting out to this destination! This will
be a fun hike for a gaggle of kids looking to toddle or run wild!

\chapter{Trail 7: Sequoyah Park}\label{trail-7-sequoyah-park}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-6}

This is another gem among Knoxville city parks, nestled in the heart of
the the city in a neighborhood. The trail starts at a large parking area
near the restroom building and walks towards the river. It follows the
river past open fields, trees, and bushes which playfully beckon for
kids not to explore! The trail cuts up toward the greenway and hikes
past Indian burial mounds and the historic homes along the path before
returning to the start. In mild weather, it is a fantastic spot to hang
up a hammock, fish, have a picnic, or toss a frisbee or a football. This
outing is ideal for kids of all walking ages, and alternate ways to
access the greenway make it easy to create a shorter loop.

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-7}

This trail is a nice introduction to the area of Ijams that is centered
around Mead's Quarry, which Ijams refers to as the Quarryside area. The
hike begins at the quarry and winds up a smooth then rocky trail. The
overlook is for Ijams Crag, a popular outdoor rock climbing area. We
love having a snack at the shade of the pine trees at the overlook.
After winding back to the start, be sure to explore one of the two
excellent nature play areas nearby or take a side trail back to extend
the trip. This area offers something for all ages, but the hike itself
is best suited to young hikers who are able navigate steeper, rocky
terrain. Younger hikers will need assistance.

\chapter{Trail 9: William Hastie}\label{trail-9-william-hastie}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-8}

You'll be surrounded by trees galore at William Hastie! The start
features a beginner's mountain bike loop on a smooth path. Though short,
this hike takes you by many spur trails; consider this a gentle
introduction to a trail system close to but more rustic than Ijams. Good
for all toddling and walking kids and their families.

\chapter{Trail 10: Sharp's Ridge}\label{trail-10-sharps-ridge}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-9}

This hike is just north of downtown, making it a great stop before
grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant or heading downtown. Wind
up from the trailhead on a smooth path through the pretty forest. When
we think of this trail, we think of little ones toddling or running
ahead around the bends in the trail, just far enough to be out of sight
for a little bit until we catch up! Once you connect to the road,
consider walking up to an overlook with lovely view of the Smokies. Best
for older kids or younger kids who are carried in a carrier or backpack.

\chapter{Trail 11: Norris Dam}\label{trail-11-norris-dam}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-10}

Part of Norris Dam State Park, around thirty minutes north of Knoxville
on the pretty Norris Lake. This hike is one of the flattest we feature.
Further, it's on a graded gravel path. Like the Knox-Blount Greenway
along the Tennessee River, you may be surprised by the variety and
quantity of wildlife you see along this scenic river, the Clinch. A
relaxing trail for a family outing that might end with a drive over
Norris Dam or a stop for a bite and a drink at the nearby Clinch River
Brewery. This hike would be a fun challenge for the toddler ready to
hike a bit farther.

\chapter{Trail 12: House Mountain}\label{trail-12-house-mountain}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-11}

The highest point in Knox County (but far from the highest in the book),
this trail feels like it belongs in another section of the book. The
elevation gain is substantial, and the trail is rockier and rougher than
the others close to Knoxville. This one always challenges us! But, the
flip side is that House Mountain offers a challenging hike to a
rewarding overlook far nearer to Knoxville than those in the Cumberland
Plateau or the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The trail climbs up
House Mountain from the west, reaching the West Overlook before heading
down to complete the clockwise loop (you're free to hike it in the
opposite direction). Good for older kids or families able to carry a
little one a farther distance.

\part{The Cumberland Plateau}

We were surprised to learn that there even is a Cumberland Plateau -
more or less to the west and north of Knoxville. It's both a plateau
and---particularly to the north---a mountainous region, especially
Frozen Head State Park.

Its defining characteristic is its geology: incredible rock features
that result principally from fast-eroding sandstone. You'll see rock
formations large and (striking) large on all of your hikes in the
plateau; some of these may amaze you that they are in East Tennessee.

These hikes are some of the most special to us in this book; a little
off-the-radar and even underappreciated, part of our motivation for
writing this book was to draw attention to these hidden gems.

\chapter{Trail 13: Emory Falls}\label{trail-13-emory-falls}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-12}

Writing about this trail makes us smile. In many ways, it's the perfect
kid hike! It starts at a beautiful trailhead along a pretty creek in the
deep woods. It gradually climbs before stopping at a scenic waterfall,
DeBord Falls---one of two, and a perfectly acceptable place to turn
around with younger kids (we have many times). It continues further to
Emory Falls before returning on a gradual slope back to the trailhead.
Stop at the playground you passed on the way to the trailhead beside the
same creek; the water is usually shallow enough to be perfect for
splashing and rock hopping. Best for kids comfortable with rocky trails.

\chapter{Trail 14: Obed Point}\label{trail-14-obed-point}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-13}

Just far enough to be off the radar of many in Knoxville, this trail has
a bit of everything - fun bridge crossings, deep forest, waterfalls, and
two pretty overlooks. It does not climb so much as to become tiresome,
but it's long enough to feel like a real adventure. There's something
about the Obed area that feels both wild and inviting. The only
downside? It's a little out-of-the-way; in some ways, this trail feels
farther than some destinations in the Smokies. It's worth it for a great
family hike with kids of all ages. Though out of the way, there are a
few fun things to do to extend the hike or to visit very nearby on the
way home. Great for kids of all hiking ages, and not a bad hike on which
to carry a little one.

\chapter{Trail 15: Bandy Creek}\label{trail-15-bandy-creek}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-14}

A welcoming, gentle introduction to the Big South Fork. Best if you're
staying at the campground -- or if you're hiking the nearby Angel Falls
Trail or the Fall Branch Falls trails. Starts at the visitor center.
This happens to be the flattest trail in the book, and it's a short
trail, but it's almost entirely on a dirt path. This is a great hike for
toddlers or little kids, and it is good for carried infants.

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-15}

Part of the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area, a
National Park Service-administered area that is a perfect counterbalance
to the wonderful but far more familiar Great Smoky Mountains National
Park. This hike, like the Big South Fork, is quieter and subtler than
the Smokies. It features unique rock cliffs that are perfect for kids to
ogle and explore. The visitor center, horse stables---not to mention
100s of miles of nearby trails, complement the hike. Because you can
turn around at any point, suitable for kids of any ages. Just be aware
of the ladders that can be a little tricky for the youngest kids to
navigate!

\chapter{Trail 17: Twin Arches}\label{trail-17-twin-arches}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-16}

This short hike leads to one of the most surprising geologic features in
Tennessee---the Twin Arches, a 130-foot span and 100-foot height feature
you can walk over, around, and through. The surrounding forest is not
shabby, either. This is a fantastic and memorable family hike, with some
challenges sprinkled in. First, this hike is the farthest (by driving
distance) of any in this book. Second, there are some rocky sections
that require some carefulness. Still, this is a must-see, and it's near
many features (and places to camp) to make a visit more accommodating.
Good for families with children of any walking age.

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-17}

Like a few of the other trails in or near the Cumberland Plateau, this
is a spectacular hike that is a little off-the-radar of many in
Knoxville. This is a spectacular hike that is a little tricky to get to
for a day hike. Still, the view is awesome, rivaling the summits of the
Smokies with a different kind of vantage --- here, of the beautiful Big
South Fork River. This trail is relatively flat and relatively short,
making it appropriate for families with young children. Consider camping
at the nearby Bandy Creek campground, and consider this hike a day's
excursion from there.

all but the most intrepid whitewater paddlers.

Unreal! This trail features rope ladders, wooden ladders, gigantic
sandstone walls, a scenic overlook, a trail that traverses \emph{up} a
river, and boulders you crawl over and through. It's spectacular and
challenging. A memorable trail that exemplifies what makes the
Cumberland Plateau region such a worthy complement to the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park. Younger children may be able to hike the first
half (traveling counterclockwise from the trailhead); you can walk the
road back to the trailhead. The second half of the trail contains more
challenging (but very beautiful) sections. Still, it's hard --- probably
the most difficult for most in this book.

\part{The Great Smoky Mountains National Park}

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited National
Park in the United States. It's an astonishing place --- high mountain
ridges with plants reminiscent of the northern United States and even
Canada; river and creek beds with abundant aquatic wildlife; a place of
wild bears and stories and the history of both Cherokee and European
settlers still present.

There's no way around these hikes being the heart of this book. That is
not meant to diminish those close to Knoxille and the Cumberland
Plateau, which in other parts of the country would stand apart as
destinations in their own right. It just speaks to how special the
Smokies can be.

That said, a note and a warning. The high number of visitors and the
proximity of Knoxville have key for families: you can be choosy about
when and where to go! While there are few things more special than a
Smokies hike up, for example, a beautiful creek on a perfect Fall day,
there are few things more challenging than being stuck in traffic, no
trail in sight, with tired out kid, or ending up on a trail that feels
more like a line at nearby Dollywood than a hike in the woods. But, this
is the benefit of living in Knoxville, and even in the height of the
summer, there are trails to visit---and times to visit---that will
surprise you with how few people there are!

An adventurous hike in the Smokies accessible to many families, it is
also a great introduction to the Smokies, particularly when visiting
from around Knoxville (it's fairly close). It's on the Great Smoky
Mountains Institute site at Tremont, a national leader in outdoors and
environmental education. It is the first hike in this section for a good
reason. The proximity to Townsend is a bonus. Best for little kids and
big kids.

The address and coordinates are for the Great Smoky Mountains Institute,
as this is the easiest-to-locate destination. When nearly there (less
than a quarter of a mile from the destination), you'll cross a bridge to
enter the Institute. You'll see a lot of parking around --- and the gift
shop. Though the trailhead and Google Maps will navigate you a little
further, the parking you see here is the best place to park. From this
parking lot, walk up the road a little toward the Spruce Flats Falls

\chapter{Trail 21: Little River}\label{trail-21-little-river}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-20}

This hike is a great introduction to the Great Smoky Mountains National
Park by featuring a bit of many of the elements that make the Smokies
special --- a trail along a beautiful, clear river; a waterfall;
abundant plant and aquatic wildlife; deep forest; and human history in
the form of historic cabins. It's close to many amenities, and the drive
from Knoxville is doable in a day. The hike starts at the Little River
trailhead, following the Little River along its namesake river. Turn
around near the small waterfall or continue the loop back to the
trailhead. Great for kids of all ages because there is not any one spot
you must reach on the trail; hike as far as you like and then head back
to the start to picnic or check out the historic cabins!

\chapter{Trail 22: Mouse Creek}\label{trail-22-mouse-creek}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-21}

Surprisingly close to Knoxville, given how remote and wild this
trailhead and trail feels, Mouse Creek in the Big Creek area of the
Smokies is quite a bit less well-known than many of the other trails in
the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in this book. The creek that
this trail follows looks otherwordly - clear and almost turquoise in
color. This hike starts at a trailhead at the Big Creek Picnic Area ---
beside the Big Creek Campground. The trail starts off a little steep,
but the trail is wide and smooth; like the Middle Prong trail, this
trail used to be a railroad bed. The trail follows above the creek and
then returns closer to it, with Mouse Creek Falls as the turn-around. A
good day-trip adventure for kids and families; the smooth grade makes
this an achievable hike for younger littles.

\chapter{Trail 23: Whiteoak Sink}\label{trail-23-whiteoak-sink}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-22}

This is the wildflower hike in the Smokies. It's a joy in mid-late
April, depending on the year's weather. This hike starts on the
kid-friendly Schoolhouse Gap trail and then connects to the Whiteoak
Sink trail, which is a bit rockier but still hike-able by younger
children. You may notice that Whiteoak Sink does not appear on the
National Park Service trail map for the Smokies; technically, Whiteoak
Sink is not an official trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National
Park, and the key takeaway for hikers is to respect this unique area of
the park by staying on the trail and refraining to pick wildflowers. It
is a must-hike during wildflower season, but also worth a trip outside
of that elusive spring period. Because of the length, best for younger
kids who are carried some or all of the way, or kids who are comfortable
with a longer hike.

Native perennial plants with distinctive three-petal flowers that bloom
in the spring. These shade-loving plants are often found in the forest
understory, where their seeds are dispersed and buried by ants, in a
process called myrmecochory. Trillium plants are protected in many
places because they are extremely slow-growing. For some species, it can
take anywhere from 5-9 years from being planted to their first bloom; a
single plant can live up to 25 years! So, next time you see one, make
sure you appreciate their beauty with your eyes only.\\

  ****Exploring the Cades Cove loop.**** A drive around the Cades Cove
  Loop can complement a hike to Whiteoak Sink. We recommend only driving
  this beautiful loop road outside of the busiest times (summer and fall
  weekends and holidays, mainly) when traffic can be intense. Consult
  the Abrams Fall hike for additional details on this area and nearby
  amenities.
\item
  ****Visiting Townsend.**** Like the Chestnut Tops hike, visiting ``The
  Peaceful Side of the Smokies,'' Townsend, is a great way to end this
  trip to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
\item
  ****Hiking the West Prong Trail.**** The nearby West Prong Trail is a
  favorite that didn't quite make it into this book, but it is still a
  worthy destination. Instead of hiking up Schoolhouse Gap (like for
  this trail), cross the road and hike to the scenic backpacking site
  \#18 as the turn-around spot beside a wood log bridge and pretty
  creek.

\chapter{Trail 24: Middle Prong}\label{trail-24-middle-prong}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-23}

This hike is great for families looking to have an authentic hiking
experience deep in the Smokies while still being only a little over an
hour's drive from Knoxville. A benefit of this hike is its
distance--only 0.6 miles to the waterfall, but along a stream that
affords many chances to hop in and splash. The turn-around spot is an
overlook to a waterfall, Lynn Camp Prong, though the trail continues
after the cascades up to another waterfall, Indian Flats Falls. Given
the ample shade and easy access to the stream, this is a great hike for
the summer, but it is enjoyable in all seasons. Good for kids of all
ages.

\chapter{Trail 25: Abrams Creek}\label{trail-25-abrams-creek}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-24}

Abrams Creek is a great place to start hiking in the Smokies if you live
in or around Knoxville. It's accessible, offers a wide variety of
features to please all members of the family, and has the added bonus of
being beautiful! The enduring memory from this trail is of kids
splashing endlessly in the shallow creeks. This was the first place we
traveled as a family in the Smokies, and we returned again and again
because we always enjoyed our time together there. There are many ways
to shorten the hike, and we often hike around a mile in and then turn
around. It can be warmer here in the summer months, but the river offers
many opportunities to swim and splash around, making it a great
destination for the summer as well. This hike is relatively challenging
and better suited to hiking with older children, but the beauty of this
hike is its versatility.

It never seems to become crowded at Abrams Creek, but parking can be a

  \textbf{Camping at Abrams Creek Campground.} This is a lovely
  creekside campground that you pass on this hike. Consider a stay in
  the summer, when jumping in the cool, not-too-deep creek can be a
  respite from the heat---or in the fall when this area pops with fall
  colors.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Trail 26: Look Rock}\label{trail-26-look-rock}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-25}

This is a short but rewarding overlook hike that is just a moderate
drive from Knoxville. The entire hike is paved --- but the trail is
steep. Start at a parking area with a very scenic overlook. The trail
starts steep but then levels out. At the top is a tower that affords
views of the Smokies as well as the Tennessee Valley and Knoxville.
Clear days are more often found in the winter, spring, and fall (after
the humidity drops). Consider coupling with a drive along the Foothills
Parkway, or take visitors here after you pick them up from the airport
in nearby Maryville, as we have with our parents! This is a fun family
thike with littles that serve as a nice and usually not crowded
introduction to the Smokies.

  for this hike, you briefly drove on the Foothills
  Parkway---Tennessee's scenic parkway that receives far fewer visits
  than the well-known Blue Ridge Parkway. But this is an underrated road
  featuring scenic overlooks of the Smokies and limited traffic. Drive

\chapter{Trail 27: Chestnut Top}\label{trail-27-chestnut-top}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-26}

Steep but quiet and rewarding, Chestnut Top is a fun choice for a
shorter hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This hike is
one of the closest to Knoxville. Furthermore, it is close to the
amenities of Townsend --- a far quieter town than Pigeon Forge and
Gatlinburg. The trail starts with a steep climb until it reaches a rocky
point that is a great stopping point; we always grab a snack here, and
kiddos like to hike on or around the rocks. The trail continues along
the trail past pretty mountain laurel, typically in bloom around mid-May
through early June, stopping at a fun but somewhat arbitrary point - a
hollow tree! Continue farther if you like, or head back to the start and
the Townsend Wye, a great picnic and water play spot. Best for kids who
are comfortable with a steady climb.

  Alexander Pkwy, Townsend, TN 37882) and the next-door Peaceful Side
  Creamery.
\item
  \textbf{Swimming at the Townsend Wye.} This is a classic summertime
  Smokies activity. From the large parking area near the trailhead, swim
  in the Little River beside the Townsend Wye---the three-way
  intersection of Townsend Entrance Road (toward Townsend), Laurel Creek
  Road (to Cades Cove), and Little River Gorge Road (toward Gatlinburg).
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Trail 28: Abrams Falls}\label{trail-28-abrams-falls}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-27}

This is a classic Smokies hike along the scenic Abrams Creek, ending in
an epic waterfall. The only downside? You must drive (or, on Wednesdays
in the summer, bike!) through Cades Cove to get to the trailhead, and
Cades Cove is often busy. We recommend either being prepared for
extensive traffic in Cades Cove or visiting during the week or outside
of the busy warm weather weekends. With that caveat in mind, we
recommend this as a true day-long family adventure worthy of a visit.
The trail starts at a scenic trailhead near the intersection of two
pretty creeks. it hikes through the piney forest, climbing a little at a
few points. Abrams Falls is a wonderful spot for a lengthy picnic before
returning to the start. Best for older children or younger children who
are carried when their little legs get tired.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Visiting the visitor center.} The Cades Cove Visitor Center
  (5686 Cades Cove Loop Rd, Townsend, TN 37882) up the road is a store,
  but it also abuts several nearby historical structures that are worth
  a visit)---the Cades Cove Historical Grist Mill and the John P Cable
  Drive Thru Barn (that you walk, rather than drive, to and through!).
  Try to find your way to Mill Creek to cool off in warm weather.
\item
  \textbf{Stopping at historic cabins and scenic lookouts.} Though it
  can be busy with traffic, especially during peak visitation periods
  (summer and fall weekends, in particular), a drive through Cades Cove
  is punctuated with numerous opportunities to stop at historic cabins
  and scenic lookouts. Plus, much of the year, you and others will stop
  to see wildlife---deer, turkey, and often bears!
\item
  \textbf{Bike the Cades Cove Loop.} Biking the Cades Cove Loop on
  car-free Wednesdays during the summer and into the early fall is a
  classic Smokies activity. We know it's a lot for kids to bike (or be
  carried out on a bike) and to hike, so this may be best as a separate
  day trip.

\chapter{Trail 29: Andrews Bald}\label{trail-29-andrews-bald}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-28}

Andrews Bald is the under-rated twin to Kuwohi (formerly known as
Clingman's Dome). Kuwohi is the highest point in the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park --- the highest point in Tennessee and among the
highest in the Eastern United States. Why Andrews Bald instead of
Kuwohi? The path to Kuwohi is often exceptionally crowded. It is still
worth a visit, but Andrews Bald is as or more exceptional in some ways:
instead of reaching a crowded overlook, Andrews Bald is a grassy bald
overlooking layers of mountains. Pair it with a trip to Kuwohi or a stop
at Newfound Gap, perhaps catching sunset after an afternoon hike to
Andrews Bald. One memorable experience for us: we saw a bear on this
trail, our first as a family. The hike has some rocky elements, and it
can be lengthy, so we recommend this hike for older children.

The above address is for the trailhead for Kuwohi---formerly named
Clingman's Dome until renamed to its traditional name to the Cherokee,
Kuwohi. in 2023. Parking here can be difficult to find during busy
periods (especially during the summer, during breaks, and on weekends
during the fall).

Consider visiting outside of these busy periods to avoid being stuck
waiting to find a spot. After finding a spot, walk toward the Kuwohi
Visitor Center. Look for the signs for the Forney Ridge Trail (it's just
a few feet to the left along the same path as the Kuwohi Trail).

Note the ``Christmas tree smell''! Afflicted by the Balsam Wooly Adelgid
and potentially a changing climate around the ridge of the Smokies,
including Kuwohi, you'll note both dead and diseased and healthy
specimens. Recent evidence suggests that the Fraser Firs are healthier
as a population than 20-30 years ago.

\item
  \textbf{Stopping at Newfound Gap.} On the way to Andrews Bald, you
  passed Newfound Gap---the mountain pass and scenic overlook atop the
  state line between Tennessee and North Carolina. This is a good place
  to stop for photos or a brief (or lengthier!) hike on the Appalachian

\chapter{Trail 30: Alum Cave Bluffs}\label{trail-30-alum-cave-bluffs}

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview-29}

This is a hike up arguably \emph{the} finest trail in the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park. The trail starts at a pretty trailhead along
Highway 441, the main road through the park. The trail continues along
the super scenic Alum Cave Creek; the trail is very well-maintained and
easily hiked by younger children. The trail climbs through a unique
geological feature you hike \emph{through}, Arch Rock, then heads up
more steeply toward Mt. LeConte. The trail then crosses an overlook
surrounded by Mountain Laurel before climbing farther toward Alum Cave,
yet another unique geological feature, Alum Cave, you hike
\emph{beneath.} It's epic. This is a perfect spot for a rest and a
picnic before returning to the trailhead. This is a challenging hike,
and finding parking can also be a challenge, but it is worth the
investment of time and effort, particularly for older kids or little
kids looking for a big challenge.

Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 35.62872, -83.45076

This is one of the busiest parking areas and trailheads in the park.
Particularly with children, visiting during periods that are less busy
can be essential for quickly finding a spot. Apart from visiting outside
of busy periods, arriving in the early-mid afternoon can be a good time,
as many who arrived in the morning are departing. Try to park at one of
the two parking areas immediately beside the trailhead (one alongside
the road, the other near the seasonal toilet). If you cannot, other
parking is available, but from those you have to walk along the side of
the road to reach the trailhead. If two or more adults are present,
consider dropping children off with one adult, while the other finds a
spot. After finding a spot, look for the signs for the Alum Cave Trail.

\item
  \textbf{Hiking on to LeConte for a grand adventure!} You may continue
  farther along on the Alum Cave Trail to Mount LeConte, a peak with
  only around 40 feet less height than Kuwohi, but only accessible via
  (lengthy) hikes---the roundtrip hike from the Alum Cave Trail
  Trailhead to Mount LeConte is around 11 very challenging miles. There
  is a lodge at which you can reserve a rustic room---LeConte Lodge
  (LeConte Lodge · Gatlinburg, TN 37738)---but it can be difficult to
  secure a reservation. The LeConte Lodge includes a store at which day
  hikers can purchase snacks, coveted t-shirts, and even more coveted
