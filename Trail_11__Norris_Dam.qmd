## Trail 11: Norris Dam State Park

### Overview

If you're looking for a trail that youngest walkers can succeed it, head north of Knoxville about 30 minutes and check out the Songbird trail at Norris Dam State Park. Further, it's on a graded gravel path. Like the Knox-Blount Greenway along the Tennessee River. You may be surprised by the variety and quantity of wildlife you see along the scenic Clinch River, which this hike invites you to enjoy as you stroll. This is a relaxing trail for a family outing that might end with a drive over Norris Dam or a stop for a bite and a drink at the nearby Clinch River Brewery. On warmer days, you'll enjoy cooler temps at this riverside trail due to its location in the valley near water. For toddlers who are no longer happy in a stroller or backpack carrier, this hike would be a fun and rewarding challenge!

### Directions to the Trailhead

Trailhead Address: Canoe Ramp by the Songbird Loop, 6W6G+R7 Rocky Top, Tennessee

Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 36.21210, -84.07397

There are several possible trailheads. We chose to start this hike from a put in spot for kayaks and canoes. In Google Maps, you can search the above address. Please note it uses a "Plus code" instead of a street address, as the canoe ramp does not have an address. This is immediately off Norris Fwy. (Highway 441).

### Nearby

-   **Grab a bite and a drink Clinch River Brewery.** Clinch River Brewing (2045 Norris Fwy, Norris, TN 37828) is not within the boundaries of the Norris Dam State Park---but it's very close to the trailhead and is a fun place to stop for lunch or dinner before or after a hike.
-   **Check out the Norris Dam, which has been in operation since the mid-1930s.** Stop at the TVA Norris Dam Visitor Center on the same side of the Clinch River as this hikeâ€”or drive across and back over the dam for an impressive, even otherworldly experience!
