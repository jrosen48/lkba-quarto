## Trail 11: Norris Dam

### Overview

Part of Norris Dam State Park, around thirty minutes north of Knoxville on the pretty Norris Lake. This hike is one of the flattest we feature. Further, it's on a graded gravel path. Like the Knox-Blount Greenway along the Tennessee River, you may be surprised by the variety and quantity of wildlife you see along this scenic river, the Clinch. A relaxing trail for a family outing that might end with a drive over Norris Dam or a stop for a bite and a drink at the nearby Clinch River Brewery. This hike would be a fun challenge for the toddler ready to hike a bit farther.

### Directions to the Trailhead

Trailhead Address: Canoe Ramp by the Songbird Loop, 6W6G+R7 Rocky Top, Tennessee Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 36.21210, -84.07397 \|

There are several possible trailheads, all easy to access. We chose to start this hike from a put in spot for kayaks and canoes. In Google Maps, you can search the above address. Please note it uses a "Plus code" instead of a street address, as the canoe ramp does not have an address. This is immediately off Norris Fwy. (Highway 441) --- curiously, the same highway that bisects the Smokies. Park in the large parking lot and head toward the river.

### Nearby

-   Stopping by the Clinch River Brewery. Clinch River Brewing (2045 Norris Fwy, Norris, TN 37828) is not within the boundaries of the Norris Dam State Park---but it's very close to the trailhead and is a fun place to stop for lunch or dinner before or after a hike.
-   Checking out Norris Dam. Stop at the TVA Norris Dam Visitor Center on the same side of the Clinch River as this hike --- or drive across and back over the dam for an impressive---and a bit of an otherworldly---view and experience.
