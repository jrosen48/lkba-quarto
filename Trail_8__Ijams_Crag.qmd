### Overview

This trail is a nice introduction to the half of Ijams that is centered around Mead's Quarry -- what Ijams refers to as the Quarryside area The hike begins at the quarry and winds up a smooth -- then rocky -- trail.
The overlook is for Ijams Crag, a popular outdoor rock climbing area.
We love having a snack at the shade of the pine trees at the overlook.
After winding back to the start, be sure to explore one of the two excellent nature play areas nearby or take a side trail back to extend the trip.
It is hikable by older kids due to the rockiness and steepness; younger kids may need a carry.

### Nearby

-   Stopping by the Ijams Visitor Center. Check out the Ijams River and Tower loop for an introduction to this other area of the Ijams Nature Center.
-   Playing at the Ijams Nature Playscape. An amazing and surprising part of Ijams, worthy of a visit on its own. Tucked away a bit on the side of the parking area at Mead's Quarry. It's a favorite for kids, with a treehouse, tightrope, stumps for jumping, and---yes---a mud pit!
-   Playing at the Ijams Primal playground. Also nearby, smaller than the Nature Playground, but packed with features for climbing and jumping.
