## Trail 8: Ijams Crag

### Overview

This trail is a nice introduction to the area of Ijams that is centered around Mead's Quarry, which Ijams refers to as the Quarryside area. The hike begins at the quarry and winds up a smooth then rocky trail. The overlook is for Ijams Crag, a popular outdoor rock climbing area. We love having a snack at the shade of the pine trees at the overlook. After winding back to the start, be sure to explore one of the two excellent nature play areas nearby or take a side trail back to extend the trip. This area offers something for all ages, but the hike itself is best suited to young hikers who are able navigate steeper, rocky terrain. Younger hikers will need assistance.

### Nearby

-   **Make sure to stop by the Ijams Visitor Center for a unique gift shop and a small collection of local river-based animals!** Check out the Ijams River and Tower loop for an introduction to this other area of the Ijams Nature Center.
-   **Play at the Ijams Nature Playscape.** This is an amazing part of Ijams, worthy of a visit on its own. Tucked away a bit on the side of the parking area at Mead's Quarry. It's a favorite for kids, with a treehouse, tightrope, stumps for jumping, and, yes, a mud pit!
-   **Check out the Ijams Primal playground.** Also nearby, smaller than the Nature Playground, but packed with features for climbing and jumping for kids able to climb and explore with little adult assistance.
