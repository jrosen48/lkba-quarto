## The Cumberland Plateau

This section describes seven hikes around the Cumberland Plateau. This region is the hidden gem near Knoxville. It's both a plateau and---particularly to the north and west of Knoxville---a mountainous region.

Its defining characteristic is its geology: incredible rock features that result principally from fast-eroding sandstone. You'll see rock formations large and (striking) large on all of your hikes in the plateau; some of these may amaze you that they are in East Tennessee. 

These hikes are some of the most special to us in this book; a little off-the-radar and even underappreciated, part of our motivation for writing this book was to draw attention to these hidden gems.
