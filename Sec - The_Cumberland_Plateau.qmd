## The Cumberland Plateau

We were surprised to learn that there even is a Cumberland Plateau - more or less to the west and north of Knoxville. It's both a plateau and---particularly to the north---a mountainous region, especially Frozen Head State Park. 

Its defining characteristic is its geology: incredible rock features that result principally from fast-eroding sandstone. You'll see rock formations large and (striking) large on all of your hikes in the plateau; some of these may amaze you that they are in East Tennessee. 

These hikes are some of the most special to us in this book; a little off-the-radar and even underappreciated, part of our motivation for writing this book was to draw attention to these hidden gems.
