## Trail 10: Sharp's Ridge

### Overview

A hike that starts very close to the city center of Knoxville -- just north.
Wind up from the trailhead on a smooth path through the pretty forest.
When we think of this trail, we think of little ones toddling or running ahead around the bends in the trail, just far enough to be out of sight for a little bit until we catch up!
Connect to the road and -- optionally -- walk up to an overlook from which the Smokies are visible.
A short but sweet family hike that's close to many amenities.
Best for older kids or younger kids who are carried.

### Directions to the Trailhead

Trailhead Address: Sharps Ridge Trailhead, 599-501 Ridge Ave, Knoxville, TN 37917
Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 36.00344, -83.93787

The trailhead can be just a little tricky to find---partially because Google Maps has several trailheads with the same name!
We once met friends at different Sharps Ridge Trailheads!
Consider putting in the address (above) to find the trailhead, which is at the end of Hanover St. Park in one of the parking spots or the gravel area on the side of Ridge Ave.

|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| 0.0                 | Start by walking through the Arbor, past the handy trail map of the Sharps Ridge area. You're technically on the very short Hanover Access trail.              |
| 0.1                 | Turn right onto Lincoln Trail. Wind up through the deep woods and easy curves in the trail.                                                                    |
| 0.8                 | Turn right onto Sharp Shin.                                                                                                                                    |
| 0.9                 | Meet Sharps Ridge Memorial Park Drive, a road. Turn left to walk along the side of the road toward the overlook --- or, alternatively, head back to the start! |
| 1.15                | Overlook. See if you can spy the Sunsphere, Neyland Stadium, and the Smokies in the distance. Turn around to head back the way you came.                       |
| 1.4                 | Turn right, back onto Sharp Shin.                                                                                                                              |
| 1.5                 | Turn left onto Lincoln Trail.                                                                                                                                  |
| 2.2                 | Turn left onto the Hanover Access Trail.                                                                                                                       |
| 2.3                 | Traihead.                                                                                                                                                      |

### Nearby

-   Stopping at nearby restaurants and shops. Favorite nearby spots include the fantastic Wild Love Bakehouse (1625 N Central St, Knoxville, TN 37917), the quick, inexpensive, tasty Taqueria La Herradura (2625 N Broadway, Knoxville, TN 37917), and Hard Knox Pizza Central (2300 N Central St, Knoxville, TN 37917).
-   Hiking further or on other trails. Sharp's Ridge includes tons of other trails. A favorite starts at a different---but nearby---parking area, immediately behind the Cherry Creek Apartments (navigate to 3404 Dill St, Knoxville, TN 37917). We like the Lincoln Trail, which is an accessible mountain bike trail.
