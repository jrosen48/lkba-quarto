## Trail 10: Sharp's Ridge

### Overview

This hike is just north of downtown, making it a great stop before grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant or heading downtown. Wind up from the trailhead on a smooth path through the pretty forest. When we think of this trail, we think of little ones toddling or running ahead around the bends in the trail, just far enough to be out of sight for a little bit until we catch up! Once you connect to the road, consider walking up to an overlook with lovely view of the Smokies. Best for older kids or younger kids who are carried in a carrier or backpack.

### Directions to the Trailhead

Trailhead Address: Sharps Ridge Trailhead, 599-501 Ridge Ave, Knoxville, TN 37917 Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 36.00344, -83.93787

The trailhead can be just a little tricky to find---partially because Google Maps has several trailheads with the same name! We once met friends at different Sharps Ridge Trailheads! Consider putting in the address (above) to find the trailhead, which is at the end of Hanover St. Park in one of the parking spots or the gravel area on the side of Ridge Ave.

| 0.0                 | Start by walking through the Arbor, past the handy trail map of the Sharps Ridge area. You're technically on the very short Hanover Access trail.              |
| 0.1                 | Turn right onto Lincoln Trail. Wind up through the deep woods and easy curves in the trail.                                                                    |

| 0.9                 | Meet Sharps Ridge Memorial Park Drive, a road. Turn left to walk along the side of the road toward the overlook --- or, alternatively, head back to the start! |
| 1.15                | Overlook. See if you can spy the Sunsphere, Neyland Stadium, and the Smokies in the distance. Turn around to head back the way you came.                       |
| 1.4                 | Turn right, back onto Sharp Shin.                                                                                                                              |

| 2.3                 | Traihead.                                                                                                                                                      |
