### Overview

Andrews Bald is the under-rated twin to Kuwohi (formerly known as Clingman's Dome). Kuwohi is the highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park --- the highest point in Tennessee and among the highest in the Eastern United States. Why Andrews Bald instead of Kuwohi? The path to Kuwohi is often exceptionally crowded. It is still worth a visit, but Andrews Bald is as or more exceptional in some ways: instead of reaching a crowded overlook, Andrews Bald is a grassy bald overlooking layers of mountains. Pair it with a trip to Kuwohi or a stop at Newfound Gap, perhaps catching sunset after an afternoon hike to Andrews Bald. One memorable experience for us: we saw a bear on this trail, our first as a family. The hike has some rocky elements, and it can be lengthy, so we recommend this hike for older children.

### Directions to the Trailhead

Trailhead Address: Kuwohi Trailhead, HG43+QG Bryson City, North Carolina
Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 35.55680, -83.49617

The above address is for the trailhead for Kuwohi---formerly named Clingman's Dome until renamed to its traditional name to the Cherokee, Kuwohi. in 2023. Parking here can be difficult to find during busy periods (especially during the summer, during breaks, and on weekends during the fall).

Consider visiting outside of these busy periods to avoid being stuck waiting to find a spot. After finding a spot, walk toward the Kuwohi Visitor Center. Look for the signs for the Forney Ridge Trail (it's just a few feet to the left along the same path as the Kuwohi Trail).

### Nearby

-   Visiting Kuwohi (Clingman's Dome). Nearby Kuwohi and the Kuwohi Trail to access this peak feature an observation tower with views in all directions. There's also the nearby Kuwhohi Visitor Center. Both the trail and visitor center share the same parking area.
-   Stopping at Newfound Gap. On the way to Andrews Bald, you passed Newfound Gap---the mountain pass and scenic overlook atop the state line between Tennessee and North Carolina. This is a good place to stop for photos or a brief (or lengthier!) hike on the Appalachian Trail that runs through the parking lot---and toward the popular scenic overlook Charlie's Bunion, a steep, challenging eight-mile round-trip hike from Newfound Gap.
