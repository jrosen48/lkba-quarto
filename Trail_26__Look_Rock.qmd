## Trail 26: Look Rock

### Overview

This is a short but rewarding overlook hike that is just a moderate drive from Knoxville. The entire hike is paved, but the trail is steep. Start at a parking area with a very scenic overlook. The trail starts out steep but then levels out. At the top is a tower that affords views of the Smokies as well as the Tennessee Valley and Knoxville. Clear days are more often found in the winter, spring, and fall (after the humidity drops). Consider coupling with a drive along the Foothills Parkway, or take visitors here after you pick them up from the airport in nearby Maryville, as we have with our parents! This is a fun family hike with littles that serve as a nice and usually not crowded introduction to the Smokies.

### Nearby

-   **Visit Abrams Creek.** See the Abrams Creek hike for a nearby, lengthier expedition.
-   **Drive the Foothills Parkway.** On the way to the trailhead for this hike, you briefly drove on the Foothills Parkway, Tennessee's scenic parkway that receives far fewer visits than the well-known Blue Ridge Parkway. This is an underrated road featuring scenic overlooks of the Smokies and limited traffic.
