## Trail 12: House Mountain State Natural Area

### Overview

This hike is not for the faint of heart, as the elevation gain is significant! If you have littles that need to be carried, we recommend waiting to tackle this hike (Katie carried our oldest in a baby carrier up this hike when he was a baby and will honestly tell you she doesn't have fond memories of this hike). This one always challenges us! But, the flip side is that House Mountain offers a challenging hike to a rewarding overlook far nearer to Knoxville than those in the Cumberland Plateau or the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The trail climbs up House Mountain from the west, reaching the West Overlook before heading down to complete the loop.

-   **Spend some time at Zoo Knoxville on the way home.** Zoo Knoxville (3500 Knoxville Zoo Dr, Knoxville, TN 37914) is accessible from I-40, on the way to House Mountain for those traveling from Knoxville or west of the city center, is a fantastic place to spend half a day (or longer)! It is one of our family's favorite spots.
