## Deepening the Experience

You've made it a good number of miles; what's next? This chapter speaks to ways of deepening the experience of hiking with little ones.

### Grow as a hiking family

If you're anything like us, you'll have rough days on the trail. 

Further, if you're like us, there may be seasons (or even entire years!) when hiking doesn't quite "fit" like it has at other times.

We think that's okay. A joy of spending time outdoors with family is that there do not need to be high expectations. 
We don't need to hike all of the time or to have the latest outdoors gear. Instead, you---and we---can think of ourselves as growing as a hiking family. 

Does the future hold yearly family outings to Seven Islands? Epic adventures into the depth of the Smokies? We don't know where the memories we are forming now might lead; maybe that is part of the joy of hiking with little ones.

### Invite friends and family to join

Some of our best memories hiking come from inviting friends and familyâ€“especially those new to hiking. Like you may have with your kids, start small and take your time; maybe your kids can lead your guests!

### Go farther

Many of the hikes in this book are on a small part of longer trails. For example, the Alum Cave Bluffs hike in the previous chapter is around one-half of the way to the top of Mount LeConte, an epic hike to a truly majestic scenic overlook, Cliff Tops. You should try it after you develop confidence making it to the Bluffs. Particularly in the Smokies and the Cumberland Plateau, you can go (much) farther if you like. Which leads to our next two points.

### Camp

A great way to be closer to trailheads (and to have more time for long hikes) is to camp. If you haven't gone before, consider asking friends to join. 

Here are some favorite campgrounds; all have online systems that make it easy to reserve a spot:

-   *Frozen Head State Park, Big Cove*: the ideal family campground, quiet, with giant boulders and a nearby creek for kids to splash in, clean restrooms, and a playground and even a rustic library nearby.
-   *Smokies campgrounds*:
    -   *Cades Cove*: The place to camp if you want to explore or bike (on Wednesdays in the summer and early fall) the Cades Cove Loop
    -   *Elkmont*: Sprawling, and a little less spread out feeling than Cades Cove, but also a bit more scenic. Look for a site along the Little River.
    -   *Cosby*: A hidden gem and one of our family's favorites, with perhaps the most featureful quiet nature trail (not officially a trail in the Smokies!) that is connected to the campground. Mostly tent spots; has just a few spots for recreational vehicles.
-   *Bandy Creek Campground*: In Big South Fork, this is a modern, spacious, friendly campground that seems to never approach being full. Close to many great hiking trails---and the horse stables.

### Try backpacking (really!)

Like for camping, if you've never been or considered backpacking, consider asking friends who have if they would like to go. These are often referred to as "backcountry" sites (in contrast to the "frontcountry" sites in campgrounds). 

Here are some favorite spots for backpacking:

- *Smokies*:
	-   *Backcountry Site #1*: You'll see this on the Abrams Creek trail. Being only a one-mile hike to the site, this is a great first spot. 
	-   *Backcountry Site #17*: Also on the Abrams Creek trail, but considerably farther than Backcountry site #1. Super scenic, with many spots spread out in a bend of the creek.
	-   *Backcountry Site #18*: Accessible from two trails, this site is nestled along a beautiful creek crossed by a bridge.
	-   *Kephart Shelter*: One of 15 *shelters*, three-sided structures with two-level wooden floors for an easier setup (no tent required!). This shelter is a gentle and pleasant hike, but is a long drive from Knoxville.
	-   Icewater Springs Shelter*: A steep, around two-mile hike along the Appalachian trail is the path to this shelter.

- *Frozen Head State Park*:
	- *Bird Mountain*: A steep but pleasant hike up to one of the ridges of Frozen Head State Park. Passes Castle Rock, a unique and fun geologic feature.

- *Big South Fork*:

-   waterfall at Honey Creek
-   site on the Grand Gap Loop
