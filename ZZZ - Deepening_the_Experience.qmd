## Deepening the Experience

You've made it a good number of miles; what's next? This chapter speaks to ways of deepening the experience of hiking with little ones.

### Invite friends and family to join

Some of our greatest joys hiking have come from inviting friends and familyâ€“especially those new to hiking.

Many of the hikes in this book are but a small part of longer trails. For instance, the Alum Cave Bluffs hike in the previous chapter is around one-half of the way to the top of Mount LeConte, an epic hike to a truly majestic scenic overlook, Cliff Tops. You should try it after you develop confidence making it to the Bluffs. Particularly in the Smokies and the Cumberland Plateau, you can go (much) farther if you like. Which leads to our next two points.

### Camp

A great way to be closer to the hikes, and to have more time for lengthier excursions, is to camp. Here are some of our favorites; all of these are fantastic:

-   *Frozen Head State Park, Big Cove Campground*: the ideal family campground, quiet, with giant boulders and a nearby creek for kids to splash in, clean restrooms, and a playground and even a rustic library nearby.
-   *Smokies campgrounds, tent or recreational vehicle*: several of the nearby Smokies campgrounds accomodate both tents and recreational vehicles (i.e., campers)
    -   Cades Cove: The place to camp if you want to explore or bike (on Wednesdays in the summer and early fall) the Cades Cove Loop
    -   Elkmont: Sprawling, and a little less spread out feeling than Cades Cove, but also a bit more scenic. Look for a site along the Little River.
-   *Smokies campgrounds, tent friendly*:
    -   Cosby: A hidden gem and one of our family's favorites, with perhaps the most featureful quiet nature trail (not officially a trail in the Smokies!) that is connected to the campground. Mostly tent spots; has just a few spots for recreational vehicles.
    -   Abrams Creek: Small and tucket mostly along Abrams Creek, this is a fantastic place to tent camp, though it can get hot in the summer.
-   *Bandy Creek Campground*: In the Big South Fork, this is a modern, spacious, friendly campground that seems to never approach being full. Close to many great hiking trails---and the horse stables.

### Backpack

Another way to deepen the experience is to backpack. If you're a little uncertain, check out the book we recommend in the next chapter. In the Smokies, there are many shelters --- three-sided buildings that can be fun destinations for little ones (no tents needed)! Here are some specific places that we think are great for a first trip:

Backcountry sites in the Smokies:

-   Backcounty site #1

-   Backcountry site #17

-   Backcountry site #18

Shelters in the Smokies: - Shelters:

-   Kephart Shelter

-   Icewater Springs Shelter
