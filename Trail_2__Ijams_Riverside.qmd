### Overview

If you live in Knoxville, then you've probably heard of Ijams Nature Center.
It’s easy to take for granted, but we seem to find something new every time we visit — and we always have a great time.
This hike is meant to be a gentle introduction to what Ijams refers to as the Riverside area (see the Ijams Crag hike for an introduction to the second part of Ijams).
The trail starts by the Ijams Nature Center's visitor center and hikes down through a deep forest to the river.
It continues along the boardwalk trail that happens to follow the side of the very first mile of the Tennessee River.
The trail returns back up and over a rocky ridge to return to the visitor center—and the play area and links to other trails nearby.
