## Trail 2: Ijams Riverside

### Overview

It’s easy to take this destination for granted if you live in Knoxville – we seem to find something new every time we visit! Bring along your baby carrier for this hike, which is meant to be a gentle introduction to what Ijams refers to as the Riverside area. The trail starts by the Ijams Nature Center's visitor center and meanders down through a deep forest to the river. It continues along the boardwalk trail that happens to follow the side of the very first mile of the Tennessee River. The trail returns back up and over a rocky ridge to return to the visitor center. Ijams offers multiple play areas and links to other trails nearby, so you can make a day of it!
