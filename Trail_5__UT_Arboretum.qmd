### Overview

A gem that is off the radar of many in Knoxville.
Starts at a trailhead with trails heading in many directions.
Walk up the paved path past botanical specimens--including unusual conifers!
Circles around park facilities past a pretty field and forests.
Upon returning to the start, there are other trails to the different ecological zones represented in an area that is worth a visit; we like the trails near the marshy area with the surprising, clear creek, perfect for splashing in warm weather.
Suitable for kids of all ages.
