## Trail 5: UT Arboretum

### Overview

This is a gem of a hike that is off the radar for many in Knoxville, as it is tucked away in nearby Oak Ridge. Start your hike at a trailhead that offers many hiking options. We recommend walking up the paved path past botanical specimens, including uniuque conifers! Circle around park facilities past a pretty field and forests. Upon returning to the start, there are other trails to the different ecological zones represented in an area that is worth a visit; we like the trails near the marshy area with the clear creek, perfect for splashing in warm weather. Suitable for kids of all ages.
