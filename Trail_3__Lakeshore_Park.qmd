A gem in Knoxville's city park system, this hike, entirely on a paved path, circles the perimeter of the park, featuring high points, views of the Smokies, and a boardwalk along the river. It also boasts four excellent play areas along the way! Well known, but not overrated, this is a great spot for a hike that could fit into a busy weekend, or even a weeknight, and is great for young ones of all ages, truly offering something for everyone.
