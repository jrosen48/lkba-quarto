### Overview

A gem in Knoxville's city park system.
This hike, entirely on a paved path, circles the perimeter of the park, featuring high points (and views of the Smokies) and a boardwalk along the river.
Traverses past four excellent play areas this hike winds past.
Well known, but not overrated — a great spot for a hike that could fit into a busy weekend, or even a weeknight.
Good for kids of all ages; consider looping back to your start point with younger children.

### Directions to the Trailhead

| Trailhead Address         | Lakeshore Park, 6014 Lyons View Pike, Knoxville, TN 37919 |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Trailhead GPS Coordinates | 35.92389, -83.990                                         |

The address above is suitable for navigating to Lakeshore in general, but it's a large park!
Our hike starts at a large parking area near the center of the park.
To find it, entering Lakeshor from Lyons View Pike, turn left onto Cliffside Dr., and park in the large parking area on the right, immediately past Circle Dr. Start on the greenway near the parking lot, on the same side of the road on which you are parked.
Of course, you can park elsewhere nearby or in any parking area at Lakeshore.

### Nearby

-   Playing at one of the many playgrounds. There are four awesome playgrounds at Lakeshore --- Hank Rappé (universal playground with a bit of everything), Huie Woodland (nature-themed), Tower (lots of climbing opportunities!), and Central (smaller, and with workout equipment nearby).
-   Having a picnic. Lakeshore seems made for picnics. Bring one along for a grassy area or numerous seating areas near the Hank Rappé, Tower, and Central playgrounds.
