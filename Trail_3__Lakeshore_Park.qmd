## Trail 3: Lakeshore Park

### Overview

A gem in Knoxville's city park system.
This hike, entirely on a paved path, circles the perimeter of the park, featuring high points (and views of the Smokies) and a boardwalk along the river.
Traverses past four excellent play areas this hike winds past.
Well known, but not overrated — a great spot for a hike that could fit into a busy weekend, or even a weeknight.
Good for kids of all ages; consider looping back to your start point with younger children.

### Nearby

-   Playing at one of the many playgrounds. There are four awesome playgrounds at Lakeshore --- Hank Rappé (universal playground with a bit of everything), Huie Woodland (nature-themed), Tower (lots of climbing opportunities!), and Central (smaller, and with workout equipment nearby).
-   Having a picnic. Lakeshore seems made for picnics. Bring one along for a grassy area or numerous seating areas near the Hank Rappé, Tower, and Central playgrounds.
