    "text": "Preface\nWhen we moved to Knoxville in 2018, we arrived as a young family eager to explore but unsure where to begin. Initial, short trips turned into longer, more regular trips that made us start to feel at home.\nIn “Little Kids, Big Adventures,” we’ve gathered 30 of our favorite trails around Knoxville, chosen not just for scenic beauty but also for their accessibility, variety, and family-friendly qualities.\nThe book is structured to guide you from getting started to expanding your family’s outdoor adventures. Early chapters provide tips for beginners, from how to prepare for your first hike to choosing trails best suited for your family. Subsequent sections dive into specific hikes across three distinct areas: Knoxville, the Cumberland Plateau, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Each trail description is crafted to help you understand what to expect, highlighting kid-friendly features, difficulty levels, accessibility, and scenic highlights.\nHappy hiking!",

    "text": "Picture this: A sunny day in nature with your family. Your kids happily climb up and over rocks, stopping only to splash in creeks. At the end, you have a picnic on the grass on a perfect, mild but warm day without a bug to be found.\nRecord Scratch\nSure, we’d all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is almost always a bit messier and with unexpected bumps in the road.\nIf you’re like us, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even leave home. We’ve been there.\nHowever, we’ve also grown as a family who hikes, honed the process, and adjusted our expectations. And sometimes the weather is just right, we and the kiddos are having a great time, and, every once in a while, there really isn’t a bug in sight.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Sam Weisbrod\n\n\n\nWe wrote this to help our friends (and you!)\nAfter moving to Knoxville as a very young famiy in 2018, our first trip to Ijams introduced us to Knoxville’s incredible outdoor spaces. Katie discovered Seven Islands, and it was awesome—and close to home. A camping trip at Frozen Head opened our eyes. Later, visiting the Smokies sealed the deal: hiking helped us to feel connected to and later to love where we live.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\nWe don’t think we’re very special in this respect (and in most others!): One of the many joys of writing this book was discovering that we’d hiked all 30 of the trails in it.\nAs we transitioned from newcomers to becoming established, we were increasingly asked questions by our friends:\nWhere should we hike with our kids?\nand\nWhat do I need to hike with our kids?\nThis book is meant to answer those questions. But, as a sneak preview, we picked out 30 trails with an eye not only toward the trails that are scenic and exciting, but also those that are likely to balance driving distance, crowds, and kid-friendly characteristics. And, one of the many great parts about hiking is that you don’t need much to get started. Indeed, you may not need anything at all.\n\n\nWhom this book is for\nThis book is for families and others caring for children who are looking for an accessible introduction to getting started hiking around Knoxville. Furthermore, this book is also for those with a few favorite trails looking to do and learn more—find longer, more challenging hikes or be introduced to hidden gems.\nBecause this book is for those new to hiking and those with some mud on their shoes, we’ve included a wide range of hikes, from those shorter than a mile on paved trails to epic expeditions into the Smokies. Additionally, we’ve noted trails that are stroller-friendly or accessible for families with additional needs.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\nRead on for things to consider for your first hike (you don’t need much!) and some recommendations for choosing a hike.",

For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a meadow. Look for varied bird varieties and deer in all seasons! The trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and then a dirt trail make a loop around a beautiful island before returning back to the paved path.

    "text": "This region is the hidden gem near Knoxville. It’s a plateau, with valleys carved out by rivers through the softer sandstone rock that is common in this area. There are also parts that are quite mountainous, particularly near Frozen Head State Park.\nThe defining characteristic of the Cumberland Plateau is its geology: incredible rock features and rock houses. You’ll see rock formations small and (strikingly) large on all of your hikes in the plateau. Some will amaze you that they (and you) are in East Tennessee.\nSomething not very widely-recognized is that one of the most well-known hikers in American history, John Muir took his first extended hike through this area. The second chapter of A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf, a book published after his death based on his diaries, describes his crossing of the Cumberland Mountains. Describing the Emory River, he wrote, “There is nothing more eloquent in Nature than a mountain stream, and this is the first I ever saw.” He continued, “This is the most primitive county I have seen, primitive in everything. The remotest hidden parts of Wisconsin are far in advance of the mountain regions of Tennessee and North Carolina.” He concludes with a description from an overlook, “The scenery is far grander than any I ever before beheld. The view extends from the Cumberland Mountains on the north far into Georgia and North Carolina to the south, an area of about five thousand square miles. Such an ocean of wooded, waving, swelling mountain beauty and grandeur is not to be described.” One trail in this section is along part of the John Muir Trail. Like him, you may be surprised by how primitive and beautiful this area is.\nThese seven hikes hikes are some of the most special to us in this book; a little off-the-radar and even underappreciated, part of our motivation for writing this book was to draw attention to them.",

    "text": "This section includes informmation on 11 hikes in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, or the Smokies. The Smokies are an astonishing place — high mountain ridges with plants reminiscent of the northern United States and even Canada; river and creek beds with abundant aquatic wildlife; a place of wild bears and stories and the history of both Cherokee and European settlers still present.\nThere’s no way around these hikes being the heart of this book. That is not meant to diminish those close to Knoxille and the Cumberland Plateau, which in other parts of the country would stand apart as destinations in their own right. It just speaks to how special the Smokies can be.\nThat said, a note and a warning. The high number of visitors and the proximity of Knoxville have key for families: you can be choosy about when and where to go! While there are few things more special than a Smokies hike up, for example, a beautiful creek on a perfect Fall day, there are few things more challenging than being stuck in traffic, no trail in sight, with tired out kid, or ending up on a trail that feels more like a line at nearby Dollywood than a hike in the woods. But, this is the benefit of living in Knoxville, and even in the height of the summer, there are trails to visit—and times to visit—that will surprise you with how few people there are!",

The turn-around spot is an overlook to a waterfall, Lynn Camp Prong, though the trail continues after the cascades up to another waterfall, Indian Flats Falls.

Ascend gradually on the Middle Prong Trail.\n\n\n0.05\nAlmost immediately past the bridge, not the split in the trail. This hike heads to the left. A short trail, the Thunderhead Prong Quiet Walkway, heads to the right (it’s a great place for kids to play and splash on hot days!).\n\n\n0.65\nOverlook to Lynn Camp Prong. Though a short way in, this is an acceptable spot to turn around and head back to the start. The trail continues onward. This is one of many trails in the Smokies that is pretty and very worthwhile all along the way; hike as far as you or your littles like.\n\n\n2.35\nIntersection with Panther Creek Trail on the left. Continue on the Middle Prong Trail.\n\n\n3.6\nBegin a brief switchback before the waterfall at the end of this hike.\n\n\n3.8\nReach Indian Flat Falls. It’s accessible via a small opening in the trees and shrubs. After resting at the beautiful waterfall, turn around to return to the start.\n\n\n5.25\nIntersection with the Panther Creek Trail on the right.\n\n\n7.6\nTrailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\n\nNearby\n\nDrive the Cade’s Cove Loop. This is a nice way to make a longer day of your trip. Instead of returning the way you came, at the intersection of Townsend Road and Laurel Creek Road, turn left and head toward Cade’s Cove. The drive to Cade’s Cove is around 15 minutes; the loop road around Cade’s Cove takes around 45 minutes to drive–longer on busy days, especially when bears are visible–which is often! Traffic on the loop road can be severe, especially during peak times, so plan accordingly to avoid restless kiddos.\nStopping for a snack or meal in Townsend. Townsend bills itself as the “Peaceful Side of the Smokies”. Peaceful Side Social is a favorite lunch and dinner spot with kids, owing to the good food and large outdoor play area.",

    "text": "You’ve made it a good number of miles; what’s next? This chapter speaks to ways of deepening the experience of hiking with little ones.\n\nGrow as a hiking family\nIf you’re anything like us, you’ll have rough days on the trail.\nFurther, if you’re like us, there may be seasons (or even entire years!) when hiking doesn’t quite “fit” like it has at other times.\nWe think that’s okay. A joy of spending time outdoor with family is that there do not need to be high expectations. We don’t need to hike all of the time or to have the latest outdoors gear. Instead, you—and we—can think of ourselves as growing as a hiking family.\nDoes the future hold yearly family outings to Seven Islands? Epic adventures into the depth of the Smokies? We don’t know where the memories we are forming now might lead; maybe that is part of the joy of hiking with little ones.\n\n\nInvite friends and family to join\nSome of our best memories hiking come from inviting friends and family–especially those new to hiking. Like you may have with your kids, start small and take your time; maybe your kids can lead your guests!\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\n\nGo farther\nMany of the hikes in this book are on a small part of longer trails. For example, the Alum Cave Bluffs hike in the previous chapter is around one-half of the way to the top of Mount LeConte, an epic hike to a truly majestic scenic overlook, Cliff Tops. You should try it after you develop confidence making it to the Bluffs. Particularly in the Smokies and the Cumberland Plateau, you can go (much) farther if you like. Which leads to our next two points.\n\n\nCamp\nA great way to be closer to trailheads (and to have more time for long hikes) is to camp. If you haven’t gone before, consider asking friends to join.\nHere are some favorite campgrounds; all have online systems that make it easy to reserve a spot:\n\nFrozen Head State Park, Big Cove: the ideal family campground, quiet, with giant boulders and a nearby creek for kids to splash in, clean restrooms, a playground, and even a rustic library nearby.\nSmokies campgrounds:\n\nCades Cove: The place to camp if you want to explore or bike (on Wednesdays in the summer and early fall) the Cades Cove Loop\nElkmont: Sprawling, and a little less spread out feeling than Cades Cove, but also a bit more scenic. Look for a site along the Little River.\nCosby: A hidden gem and one of our family’s favorites, with perhaps the most featureful quiet nature trail (not officially a trail in the Smokies!) that is connected to the campground. Mostly tent spots; has just a few spots for recreational vehicles.\n\nBandy Creek Campground: In Big South Fork, this is a modern, spacious, friendly campground that seems to never approach being full. Close to many great hiking trails—and the horse stables.\n\n\n\nTry backpacking (really!)\nLike for camping, if you’ve never been or considered backpacking, consider asking friends who have if they would like to go. These are often referred to as “backcountry” sites (in contrast to the “frontcountry” sites in campgrounds).\nHere are some favorite spots for backpacking:\n\nSmokies:\n\nBackcountry Site #1: You’ll see this on the Abrams Creek trail. Being only a one-mile hike to the site, this is a great first spot.\nBackcountry Site #17: Also on the Abrams Creek trail, but considerably farther than Backcountry site #1. Super scenic, with many spots spread out in a bend of the creek.\nBackcountry Site #18: Accessible from two trails, this site is nestled along a beautiful creek crossed by a bridge.\nKephart Shelter: One of 15 shelters, three-sided structures with two-level wooden floors for an easier setup (no tent required!). This shelter is a gentle and pleasant hike, but is a long drive from Knoxville.\nIcewater Springs Shelter: A steep, around two-mile hike along the Appalachian trail is the path to this shelter.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\nFrozen Head State Park:\n\nBird Mountain: A steep but pleasant hike up to one of the ridges of Frozen Head State Park. Passes Castle Rock, a unique and fun geologic feature.",

    "text": "Leave No Trace: Keeping the Wilderness Wild\nThese help preserve outdoor spaces for future adventurers.\n\n1. Plan Ahead and Prepare\nCheck weather conditions before you go, and consider checking the website for the area you’ll be hiking in to ensure the trail is open and in good condition (the vast majority of the time, trails are open!). Pack appropriate gear and extra supplies, especially since you’ll be hiking with littles.\n\n\n2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces\nWhenever possible, keep to established trails and campsites (we know one of our little hikers had a different tip in an earlier chapter!). Walk single file down the middle of the path - this protects trailside plants and prevents unnecessary erosion. When camping, look for hard, dry ground or existing sites that can handle the impact.\n\n\n3. Pack It In, Pack It Out\nEverything you bring must leave with you - food scraps, hygiene products, all of it. For bathroom breaks, if you can’t make it to a bathroom, look to go at least 200 feet from water sources. For number #2, try to dig a hole to prevent run off.\n\n\n4. Leave What You Find\nThe outdoors is full of treasures. Admire them, photograph them, but it’s best to leave them where they are.\n\n\n5. Minimize Campfire Impact\nIf you need or want to have a fire (when camping), use established rings or fire pans. Keep it small, stick to local dead wood, and ensure it’s completely cold before you leave.\n\n\n6. Respect Wildlife\nWatch animals from a distance - no following, no feeding, no disturbing their homes. Store food securely and keep garbage out of reach. If you bring a doggy, keep them under control and away from wildlife.\n\n\n7. Be Considerate\nThe wilderness is for everyone. One small part of trail etiquette is to yield to those hiking up on a trail (it’s okay and understandable if little ones don’t consistently do this, but it’s a nice start to mention to those who are older!).",
