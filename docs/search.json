    "text": "A story about a hike\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note - this book is in-progress and many sections are not yet drafted or are in draft form! It is set to be published by UT Press with an expected publication date in early 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\nPicture this: A sunny day in nature with your family. Your kids happily climb up and over rocks, stopping only to splash in creeks. At the end, you have a picnic on the grass on a perfect, mild but warm day without a bug to be found.\nRecord Scratch\nSure, we’d all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is almost always a bit messier and with unexpected bumps in the road.\nIf you’re like us, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even leave home. We’ve been there.\nHowever, we’ve also grown as a family who hikes, homed on the process, and adjusted our expectations. And sometimes the weather is just right, we and the kiddos are having a great time, and, every once in a while, there really isn’t a bug in sight.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Sam Weisbrod\n\n\n\n\nWe wrote this to help our friends (and you!)\nAfter moving to Knoxville as a very young famiy in 2018, our first trip to Ijams introduced us to Knoxville’s incredible outdoor spaces. A camping trip at Frozen Head opened our eyes. Later, visiting the Smokies sealed the deal: hiking helped us to feel connected to and later to love where we live.\nWe don’t think we’re very special in this respect (and in most others!): One of the many joys of writing this book was discovering that we’d hiked all 30 of the trails in it.\nAs we transitioned from newcomers to becoming established, we were increasingly asked questions by our friends:\nWhere should we hike with our kids?\nand\nWhat do I need to hike with our kids?\nThis book is meant to answer those questions. But, as a sneak preview, we picked out 30 trails with an eye not only toward the trails that are scenic and exciting, but also those that are likely to balance driving distance, crowds, and kid-friendly characteristics. And, one of the many great parts about hiking is that you don’t need much to get started. Indeed, you may not need anything at all.\n\n\nWhom this book is for\nThis book is for families and others caring for children who are looking for an accessible introduction to getting started hiking around Knoxville. Furthermore, this book is also for those with a few favorite trails looking to do and learn more—find longer, more challenging hikes or be introduced to hidden gems.\nBecause this book is for those new to hiking and those with some mud on their shoes, we’ve included a wide range of hikes, from those shorter than a mile on paved trails to epic expeditions into the Smokies. Additionally, we’ve noted trails that are stroller-friendly or accessible for families with additional needs.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\n\nWhere the hikes are\nAll of the hikes are near Knoxville—from just a few minutes to within an hour or two drive (but no longer). Following our focus on hiking with younger children, most of the hikes are within an hour’s drive of Knoxville.\nThey are in three regions:\n\nIn and around Knoxville: Hikes within the Knoxville city limits to those within a 30-minute drive.\nThe Cumberland Plateau: An often under-appreciated but fantastic region of rock outcroppings and wild rivers to the West and North of Knoxville. The hikes in this region are from around one to two hours from Knoxville, with most being close to one hour.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park: The most-visited and the most biodiverse national park—right in Knoxville’s backyard. These are mostly around an hour from Knoxville, though a few are closer to two hours.",

    "text": "You don’t need fancy gear!\nThere’s a little secret in the hiking world. You don’t need a lot to get started. Indeed, you may not need anything new at all.\nOur view is that you don’t need anything special to enjoy your first hike. With the right trail and a few basics, you’ll be ready for an adventure.\nFirst, though, there’s another little secret we need to share.\n\n\nYou don’t need to be an experienced hiker to hike with little ones\nHiking can be different from other physical activities in that it is not a competition. Instead, it is about experiencing the outdoors in our own way.\nThis applies to beginners and to the most experienced hikers; a common saying shared among long-distance hikers is to hike your own hike. This means that each person hiking will hike in their way, and that there is not anything like a correct way to lace up your shoes and to get outdoors with your family. If this applies to long-distance hikers, we think it doubly applies to families hiking with littles! Hike your own hike.\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit to Sam Weisbrod\n\n\n\n\nLet kids take the lead\nTo help your kids develop a love for hiking and the outdoors, let them take the lead. Let them develop their own interests and explore their own curiosities when you go on a hike. Sometimes this might mean playing in a creek for half of your planned hiking time.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\n\nBe choosy about the when and where\nOne of the benefits of living close to great hiking opportunities is that we can be a little choosy about when and where we hike. While we are card carrying members of the puddle splashing club, we also appreciate that our littles may have a better time when it is not 50°F and rainy. Does it look like it is going to rain all day, border on being too cold, or be oppressively hot? You can choose another day to hike; we have enough good weather that we can avoid the less-than-ideal days.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\n\nPlan for the essentials\nAt a minimum, the following items are essential for hikes when the weather is good and you are close to home:\n\nWater\nSnacks\nA waist pack or backpack\n\nOlder kids may like to carry some of these—especially the snacks!\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Sam Weisbrod\n\n\nWhen taking on a lengthier hike or traveling farther from home, we like asking ourselves the following questions:\nWhat has the weather been? What is the weather forecast? Is it bug season?\nThese can help you to pack appropriately.\nThe appendix has some recommendations for a basic first-aid kit as well as recommendations for some optional items you may wish to bring.\n\n\nEmbrace serendipity\nIt’s good to have a plan, but don’t be surprised if something better comes along! Maybe you hike further than you thought you would, or perhaps your child surprises you (and themselves!) by taking some time to rock hop across a creek, follow animal tracks, or look at plants and flowers. Be ready to follow your child’s lead—whether that means stopping to watch a butterfly or counting animal tracks. These moments often become the most cherished.\n\n\nSelect advice\nWe asked some local hiking experts to share some additional advice. Here’s what they said:\n\n“Kids need to find things they love on hiking.” - Finn (3)\n“Find rocks while hiking.” - Ruth (5)\n“When possible, swim in the waterfalls.” - Ruth (5)\n“It’s important to go off the trail.” - Ruth (5)\n“If your baby can walk a little bit, then let them walk.” - Jonah (age 6)\n“Make sure to run and also look for bears.” - Levi (7)\n“You might want to bring pants and a sweatshirt with a hood. Because that one time I brought no pants and a sweatshirt with no hood.” - G.H. (9)\n“Games and stories are better when made up on the fly.” - D. (9)\n\nThe next chapter offers some guidance on how to pick a trail (and how to use this book).",

    "text": "Overview\nEach of the chapters for hikes starts with an Overview that give a sense for “look and feel” of the hike.\n\n\nKey Characteristics\nAfter each overview is a table with Key Characteristics of the trail, including for which ages of children the hike is best.\n\nToddlers: One-two year-olds who can walk some of the trail (being carried for other parts) or all of short trails.\nLittle kids: Two- four or five years who can walk all of short trails and even some parts of lengthier trails.\nBig kids: Four -eight or nine who can walk longer distances and who are up for bigger challenges\nPre-teens and older: Eight or nine and up\n\nOf course, you may also choose to carry your toddler, little kid, or younger big kid for some or all of these hikes.\nThe key characteristics also include the length of the hike, approximately how long it takes to hike, the elevation change (Flat, Gentle, Moderate, Steep, and Very Steep), whether pets are allowed a parking pass required, and the presence of a restroom. Finally, we also note whether the trail is accessible for those with strollers and wheelchairs.\n\n\nTrail Maps and Photos\nEach hike has a trail maps. These should be pretty straightforward to use. Trailheads—the starting points for the hikes—are marked with a green dot, and the trail is in red, with key features of the trail noted along the way. We also include one or more photos for each hike; we tried to select these to show what makes the hike unique.\n\n\nCall outs\nThe hikes are through areas rich in natural and human history, and while we felt comfortable accurately describing many of these elements, we felt we had to enlist the help of friends and colleagues for others—for which we have “call outs”. Look for these in the call-outs in most of the chapters, and consider sharing parts of them with your little hikers.\n\n\nDoing more\nEach chapter concludes with one or more things to do nearby, from places to grab a bite to eat to other, nearby hikes to consider.",

    "text": "Lists of the best hikes are helpful, but they can lead you to trails that are far away, crowded, and not suited to young kids. Furthermore, what even is the best trail to kids?\nWe bet you’ve had the experience on a family trip to someplace special only for your kiddo to be captivated by the stairs near the entrance—or, you bought a pricey gift only for the cardboard box to be the best part.\nThere’s something similar when it comes to finding a hike: Which hike is the best can be really hard to predict in advance!\nStill, we think you can set yourself up for success: We picked the hikes that are in the sweet spot for parents of younger children: not too far away, not so challenging as to be discouraging to kids and their parents; near amenities; and scenic and rewarding to accomplish.\n\nChoosing where to hike\nSome trails are short, flat, and on a paved surface. Others are longer, steeper, or rockier. How do you find which one is best for you?\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\nThis book has three sections, one each for hikes in and around Knoxville, on the Cumberland Plateau, and in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Within each section, we organized each hike loosely along the lines of those we’d recommend first.\nThus, the first few hikes in each section are what we think of as “sure bets.” Get the weather right, pack a bunch of snacks, and we think you’ll likely have a good time. We also created a list of Top 5 Hikes that can help with choosing where to hike first.\nFor example, Seven Islands in Knoxville is a reliable choice, with paved paths, beautiful views, and plenty of spots for kids to explore. Indeed, if you haven’t hiked there yet and the weather is good, we recommend you stop reading now and head out!\nEach chapter has a lot of information you can use to choose your hike—particularly information in the Overview and Key Characteristics sections. You can those for inspiration. All of the key characteristics are also provided in a table in the Overview section for easy review.\nLast, the next chapter includes a list of “Top 5s” - our top recommendations for hikes with different characteristics. Check those out and pick a hike, and you’re ready to head out!",

Ijams on the south side of Knoxville–familiar to many in the Knoxville area–has many spectacular features, in addition to being fewer than ten minutes away from downtown.\nOther places that we highlight among the 12 trails in this secton are very worth your time, offering an outdoors respite in addition to the ability to easily be integrated into busy schedules and other commitments.

For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a meadow. Look for varied bird varieties and deer in all seasons! The trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and then a dirt trail make a loop around a beautiful island before returning back to the paved path.

    "text": "Overview\nThis hike is just north of downtown, making it a great stop before grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant or heading downtown. Wind up from the trailhead on a smooth path through the pretty forest. When we think of this trail, we think of little ones toddling or running ahead around the bends in the trail, just far enough to be out of sight for a little bit until we catch up! Once you connect to the road, consider walking up to an overlook with lovely view of the Smokies.

Sharp’s Ridge includes many other trails. A favorite starts at a different nearby parking area, immediately behind the Cherry Creek Apartments (navigate to 3404 Dill St, Knoxville, TN 37917).

Further, it’s on a graded gravel path. Like the Knox-Blount Greenway along the Tennessee River. You may be surprised by the variety and quantity of wildlife you see along the scenic Clinch River, which this hike invites you to enjoy as you stroll. This is a relaxing trail for a family outing that might end with a drive over Norris Dam or a stop for a bite and a drink at the nearby Clinch River Brewery. On warmer days, you’ll enjoy cooler temps at this riverside trail due to its location in the valley near water.

We chose to start this hike from a put in spot for kayaks and canoes. In Google Maps, you can search the above address.

While this memorable trail is a little tricky to get to for a day hike, the view is awesome, rivaling the summits of the Smokies, with a different kind of vantage of the beautiful Big South Fork River. This trail is relatively flat and short, making it appropriate for families with young children. Consider camping at the nearby Bandy Creek campground, and consider this hike a day’s excursion from there.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\n\nKey Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nTime Estimate\n1.5 hours - 2.5 hours\n\n\nTrail Distance (Miles)\n2.8\n\n\nElevation Change\nGentle\n\n\nPets\nAllowed on leash\n\n\nParking Pass/Entrance Fee\nNot Required\n\n\nRestroom(s)\nNo\n\n\nBest Ages\nLittle Kids and Big Kids\n\n\nStrollers and Wheelchairs\nNot Accessible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirections to the Trailhead\nTrailhead Address: Grand Gap Loop Trailhead, G84V+69 Oneida, Tennessee\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates: 36.50549, -84.65664\nThis address is for the trailhead for the Grand Gap Loop, deep into the Big South Fork National River & Recreation Area.

The second half of the trail contains more challenging (but very beautiful) sections. Still, it’s hard – probably the most difficult for most in this book, making it best for the older kiddo hiker.

The Smokies are an astonishing place — high mountain ridges with plants reminiscent of the northern United States and even Canada; river and creek beds with abundant aquatic wildlife; a place of wild bears and stories and the history of both Cherokee and European settlers still present.\nThere’s no way around these hikes being the heart of this book. That is not meant to diminish those close to Knoxille and the Cumberland Plateau, which in other parts of the country would stand apart as destinations in their own right. It just speaks to how special the Smokies can be.\nThat said, a note and a warning. The high number of visitors and the proximity of Knoxville have key for families: you can be choosy about when and where to go! While there are few things more special than a Smokies hike up, for example, a beautiful creek on a perfect Fall day, there are few things more challenging than being stuck in traffic, no trail in sight, with tired out kid, or ending up on a trail that feels more like a line at nearby Dollywood than a hike in the woods. But, this is the benefit of living in Knoxville, and even in the height of the summer, there are trails to visit—and times to visit—that will surprise you with how few people there are!",

It’s accessible, offers a wide variety of features to please all members of the family, and has the added bonus of being beautiful! The enduring memory from this trail is of kids splashing endlessly in the shallow creeks. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies, and we returned again and again because we always enjoyed our time together there. There are many ways to shorten the hike, and we often hike around a mile in and then turn around. It can be warmer here in the summer months, but the river offers many opportunities to swim and splash around, making it a great destination for the summer as well. This hike is relatively challenging and better suited to hiking in its entirety with older children, but the beauty of this hike is its versatility: you can turn-around at many points along the trail and still have a great hike!\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Sam Weisbrod\n\n\n\n\nKey Characteristics\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nTime Estimate\n4 hours - 6 hours\n\n\nTrail Distance (Miles)\n5.8\n\n\nElevation Change\nModerate\n\n\nPets\nNot Allowed\n\n\nParking Pass/Entrance Fee\nRequired\n\n\nRestroom(s)\nYes (seasonal)\n\n\nBest Ages\nAll ages\n\n\nStrollers and Wheelchairs\nNot accessible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirections to the Trailhead\nTrailhead Address: Abrams Creek Campground, J368+MR Tallassee, Tennessee\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates: 35.61095, -83.93356\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cherokee\n\n\n\nThe people of the Cherokee Nation were indigenous to a vast area to the south, east, and west of the Smokies; the Smokies were more a place for gathering and hunting than residing.

The trail starts with a steep climb until it reaches a rocky point that is a great stopping point; we always grab a snack here, and kiddos like to hike on or around the rocks.

Sevierville and (especially) Pigeon Forge feature tourist attractions, restaurants, and a very wide variety of shops; Gatlinburg is touristy but has a more small-town character. As tourist destinations, all three can be busy, but they can be fun places to stop with happy but tired kiddos.\nHiking on to LeConte for a grand adventure! You may continue farther along on the Alum Cave Trail to Mount LeConte, a peak with only around 40 feet less height than Kuwohi, but only accessible via (lengthy) hikes—the roundtrip hike from the Alum Cave Trail Trailhead to Mount LeConte is around 11 very challenging miles. There is a lodge at which you can reserve a rustic room—LeConte Lodge (LeConte Lodge · Gatlinburg, TN 37738)—but it can be difficult to secure a reservation. The LeConte Lodge includes a store at which day hikers can purchase snacks, coveted t-shirts, and even more coveted no-bake cookies.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenber",

    "text": "You’ve made it a good number of miles; what’s next? This chapter speaks to ways of deepening the experience of hiking with little ones.\n\nGrow as a hiking family\nIf you’re anything like us, you’ll have rough days on the trail.\nFurther, if you’re like us, there may be seasons (or even entire years!) when hiking doesn’t quite “fit” like it has at other times.\nWe think that’s okay. A joy of spending time outdoor with family is that there do not need to be high expectations. We don’t need to hike all of the time or to have the latest outdoors gear. Instead, you—and we—can think of ourselves as growing as a hiking family.\nDoes the future hold yearly family outings to Seven Islands? Epic adventures into the depth of the Smokies? We don’t know where the memories we are forming now might lead; maybe that is part of the joy of hiking with little ones.\n\n\nInvite friends and family to join\nSome of our best memories hiking come from inviting friends and family–especially those new to hiking. Like you may have with your kids, start small and take your time; maybe your kids can lead your guests!\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\n\nGo farther\nMany of the hikes in this book are on a small part of longer trails. For example, the Alum Cave Bluffs hike in the previous chapter is around one-half of the way to the top of Mount LeConte, an epic hike to a truly majestic scenic overlook, Cliff Tops. You should try it after you develop confidence making it to the Bluffs. Particularly in the Smokies and the Cumberland Plateau, you can go (much) farther if you like. Which leads to our next two points.\n\n\nCamp\nA great way to be closer to trailheads (and to have more time for long hikes) is to camp. If you haven’t gone before, consider asking friends to join.\nHere are some favorite campgrounds; all have online systems that make it easy to reserve a spot:\n\nFrozen Head State Park, Big Cove: the ideal family campground, quiet, with giant boulders and a nearby creek for kids to splash in, clean restrooms, a playground, and even a rustic library nearby.\nSmokies campgrounds:\n\nCades Cove: The place to camp if you want to explore or bike (on Wednesdays in the summer and early fall) the Cades Cove Loop\nElkmont: Sprawling, and a little less spread out feeling than Cades Cove, but also a bit more scenic. Look for a site along the Little River.\nCosby: A hidden gem and one of our family’s favorites, with perhaps the most featureful quiet nature trail (not officially a trail in the Smokies!) that is connected to the campground. Mostly tent spots; has just a few spots for recreational vehicles.\n\nBandy Creek Campground: In Big South Fork, this is a modern, spacious, friendly campground that seems to never approach being full. Close to many great hiking trails—and the horse stables.\n\n\n\nTry backpacking (really!)\nLike for camping, if you’ve never been or considered backpacking, consider asking friends who have if they would like to go. These are often referred to as “backcountry” sites (in contrast to the “frontcountry” sites in campgrounds).\nHere are some favorite spots for backpacking:\n\nSmokies:\n\nBackcountry Site #1: You’ll see this on the Abrams Creek trail. Being only a one-mile hike to the site, this is a great first spot.\nBackcountry Site #17: Also on the Abrams Creek trail, but considerably farther than Backcountry site #1. Super scenic, with many spots spread out in a bend of the creek.\nBackcountry Site #18: Accessible from two trails, this site is nestled along a beautiful creek crossed by a bridge.\nKephart Shelter: One of 15 shelters, three-sided structures with two-level wooden floors for an easier setup (no tent required!). This shelter is a gentle and pleasant hike, but is a long drive from Knoxville.\nIcewater Springs Shelter: A steep, around two-mile hike along the Appalachian trail is the path to this shelter.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit to Katie and Joshua Rosenberg\n\n\n\nFrozen Head State Park:\n\nBird Mountain: A steep but pleasant hike up to one of the ridges of Frozen Head State Park. Passes Castle Rock, a unique and fun geologic feature.",

    "text": "Leave No Trace: Keeping the Wilderness Wild\nThese help preserve outdoor spaces for future adventurers.\n\n1. Plan Ahead and Prepare\nCheck weather conditions before you go, and consider checking the website for the area you’ll be hiking in to ensure the trail is open and in good condition (the vast majority of the time, trails are open!). Pack appropriate gear and extra supplies, especially since you’ll be hiking with littles.\n\n\n2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces\nWhenever possible, keep to established trails and campsites (we know one of our little hikers had a different tip in an earlier chapter!). Walk single file down the middle of the path - this protects trailside plants and prevents unnecessary erosion. When camping, look for hard, dry ground or existing sites that can handle the impact.\n\n\n3. Pack It In, Pack It Out\nEverything you bring must leave with you - food scraps, hygiene products, all of it. For bathroom breaks, if you can’t make it to a bathroom, look to go at least 200 feet from water sources. For number #2, try to dig a hole to prevent run off.\n\n\n4. Leave What You Find\nThe outdoors is full of treasures. Admire them, photograph them, but it’s best to leave them where they are.\n\n\n5. Minimize Campfire Impact\nIf you need or want to have a fire (when camping), use established rings or fire pans. Keep it small, stick to local dead wood, and ensure it’s completely cold before you leave.\n\n\n6. Respect Wildlife\nWatch animals from a distance - no following, no feeding, no disturbing their homes. Store food securely and keep garbage out of reach. If you bring a doggy, keep them under control and away from wildlife.\n\n\n7. Be Considerate\nThe wilderness is for everyone. One small part of trail etiquette is to yield to those hiking up on a trail (it’s okay and understandable if little ones don’t consistently do this, but it’s a nice start to mention to those who are older!).",
