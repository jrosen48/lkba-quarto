    "text": "0.1 A Story About a Hike\nFirst comes the vision. A beautiful sunny day out in nature with your family. Your young children happily throwing rocks in rivers, wading in creeks. Oh, look! Little JoJo caught a crawdad! A picnic where everyone enjoys the food and nobody complains because you made the peanut butter and jelly on the dark brown bread (otherwise known as wheat). You cover extensive ground! Your children bask in nature! You get gorgeous pictures to share on social media. Then, the kiddos nap peacefully on the ride home while you and your spouse agree on what music or podcast to listen to.\nRecord Scratch\nSure, we’d all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is a bit messier, potentially whinier (which comes with the territory when doing activities with young kids), and comes with unexpected bumps in the road (also known as surprises, depending on how you look at these kinds of things).\nIn reality, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even leave your house. Packing for a day hike seems like it should be simple, but by the time you consider what your family will need and plan properly for the trail you’ll be spending time on, you’ve already expended a lot of mental energy and can’t muster up the patience for the car ride to the trailhead.\nOnce you arrive, the kids are hungry for the forty-third time, the baby falls and scrapes her knee and refuses to go in the carrier pack, and your oldest can’t be pulled away from the creek just beyond the trailhead to even start the hike.\nWe’ve been there more times than we can count, and have felt more relief in a hike being over than we felt excitement to go on the hike in the first place. However, we’ve also grown as a family who hikes, honed in on the process, adjusted our expectations, and have built some beautiful memories in the process.\nIf you’re a family who enjoys the outdoors, wants to enjoy the outdoors, and wants to learn more about the family hike adventures that await you, this guide is for you. In this guide, we’ll provide hiking and gear recommendations, all designed with young families in mind.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "You do not need much specialized gear to go on your first hike. Indeed, select a particular hike at a particular time, and you will not need anything particular at all. We detail those considerations: selecting a particular hike at a particular time and a few other things that are needed on practically every hike.\nDefine your own adventure. Do you need a hike that will help burn older kids’ energy? Or do you have toddlers who simply want to touch every leaf and rock you pass? Decide what’s most important for your family hike and pick a trail that best supports that!\nGive kids’ time. Want to encourage your kids to love hiking and being outside? Let them develop their own interests and explore their own curiosities when you go on a hike. Sometimes this might mean playing in a creek for half of your planned hiking time.\n\nPlan for the basics. Take a look at the weather for the area or region you’re hiking, get a gauge on the terrain, and wear or pack appropriate clothes and shoes. Oh, and snacks. Lots of snacks!\nPlan for a mess.\nWhen a kiddo plods through a creek, it sure is nice to have a backup pair of socks and shoes! Sometimes, an emergency change of clothes packed in your bag or in your car can come in handy. Some bandaids or a basic first aid kit is always nice to have in a pinch and, in general, bring more water than you think you’ll need, because you never know!\n!\nEmbrace serendipity. It’s good to have a plan, but don’t be surprised if something better comes along! Maybe you hike further than you thought you would, or perhaps your child surprises you (and themselves!) by taking some time to rock hop across a creek or explore animal tracks.",

    "text": "These hikes are within or near Knoxville, in what is often referred to as the Tennessee Valley. The Tennessee Valley includes Knoxville and many other cities that border the mountains that surround Knoxville. This area is known as the Tennessee Valley because of its primary geographic feature: The Tennessee River.\nThe Tennessee River begins just beyond the city limits of Knoxville, where the Holston and the French Broad Rivers meet. It (literally and figuratively!) contains fewer high points than the Cumberland Plateau and the Great Smoky Mountains, but, it should not be discounted as a destination for hiking.\nWe think a trip to Seven Islands State Birding Park will make how spectactular this area can be evident. Around 30 minutes away from most places in Knoxville, this is a true destination for not only birders, but also hikers and paddlers.\nOther locations are also not only close, but (surprisingly) worthy of a trip. Ijams on the south side of Knoxville–familiar to many in the Knoxville area–has many spectacular features, in addition to being fewer than ten minutes away from downtown.\nOther places that we highlight are also worth your time, offering an outdoors respite in addition to the ability to easily be integrated into busy schedules and other commitments. If you are looking for a first family hike, those in this section may make a great selection.",

Even though it is relatively close to Knoxville, it is simply a fantastic place to hike. For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a meadow. Look for birds and deer! The trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and hike around a beautiful island (look for side trails and the native paw paw fruit in the fall!) before returning to the start—or pick one of the many other nearby trails in the park. Great for all ages and seasons, though sometimes hot in the summer due to limited shade on the paved part of the trail.\n\n\n\n7.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\nTrailhead Address | Seven Islands State Birding Park, 2809 Kelly Ln, Kodak, TN 37764 |\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates | 35.95366, -83.68701\n\n\nNavigate using the above address to the main parking area (note there is another parking area by a boat launch that is not the correct location for this hike!).

Hike up the Hickory Ridge trail, another trail at Seven Islands State Birding Park that is accessible from just behind the bathrooms near the parking lot. There are several other great hikes available, including hikes down the Kelly Lane Greenway (the other, wider, paved path near the barn that is gated to prevent cars from driving on it) and the Upland Inner and Outer Trail Loops.\nEnjoying watersports. Consider kayaking, canoeing, or paddleboarding, especially on warm days. There is a great place to put in, Seven Islands Landing and Boat Ramp (2809 Kelly Ln, Kodak, TN 37764). Also, River Sports Outfitters rents kayaks and canoes here during the summer (see https://www.riversportsoutfitters.com/).\n\nStopping for a bite to eat and a drink on the way back. On the way home, consider stopping by kid-friendly Walnut Springs Winery (1175 Midway Rd, Knoxville, TN 37914), open Wednesday-Sunday as of this writing.",

This hike is meant to be a gentle introduction to what Ijams refers to as the Riverside area (see the Ijams Crag hike for an introduction to the second part of Ijams). The trail starts by the Ijams Nature Center’s visitor center and hikes down through a deep forest to the river.

The south side of town near Ijams is a great place to grab a bite to eat. Our favorites include South Coast Pizza (1103 Sevier Ave, Knoxville, TN 37920) and Angry Dumplings Tea (1119 Sevier Ave, Knoxville, TN 37920). Breweries nearby also abound.",

Paved throughout, this trail offers a glimpse of the surprising beauty of the Tennessee River so close to the city. Our description features a route that heads to the north, toward the city, and then back to the trail from the research park further south before returning to the start; of course, you can hike any way you like! Look for blue herons and other birds along the side of the river; you might see a Bald Eagle! Limited shade makes this a great outing for clear but cold winter days but a hot hike during warmer, sunnier times. This will be a fun hike for a gaggle of kids looking to toddle or run wild!\n\n\n\n12.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nUniversity of Tennessee Research Park at Cherokee Farm, 2641 Osprey Vista Way, Knoxville, TN 37920\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.94191, -83.95270\n\n\n\nPark in the lot at the above address—if helpful, the building is the “IAM Electron Microscopy Facility”!

The trail starts at a large parking area near the restroom building and walks towards the river. It follows the river past open fields, trees, and bushes that are practically impossible for kids not to explore. The trail cuts up toward the greenway and hikes past Indian burial mounds and the old (many large) houses along the path before returning to the start. In mild weather, it is a fantastic spot to hang up a hammock, go fish, have a picnic, or toss a frisbee or a football.

When we think of this trail, we think of little ones toddling or running ahead around the bends in the trail, just far enough to be out of sight for a little bit until we catch up! Connect to the road and – optionally – walk up to an overlook from which the Smokies are visible. A short but sweet family hike that’s close to many amenities.

We once met friends at different Sharps Ridge Trailheads! Consider putting in the address (above) to find the trailhead, which is at the end of Hanover St. Park in one of the parking spots or the gravel area on the side of Ridge Ave.\n\n\n16.0.4 Trail Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from Start\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0.0\nStart by walking through the Arbor, past the handy trail map of the Sharps Ridge area.

Sharp’s Ridge includes tons of other trails. A favorite starts at a different—but nearby—parking area, immediately behind the Cherry Creek Apartments (navigate to 3404 Dill St, Knoxville, TN 37917).

Like the Knox-Blount Greenway along the Tennessee River, you may be surprised by the variety and quantity of wildlife you see along this scenic river, the Clinch. A relaxing trail for a family outing that might end with a drive over Norris Dam or a stop for a bite and a drink at the nearby Clinch River Brewery.

We were surprised to learn that there even is a Cumberland Plateau - more or less to the west and north of Knoxville. It’s both a plateau and—particularly to the north—a mountainous region, especially Frozen Head State Park. Its defining characteristic is its geology: incredible rock features that result principally from fast-eroding sandstone. You’ll see rock formations large and (striking) large on all of your hikes in the plateau; some of these may amaze you that they are in East Tennessee. These hikes are some of the most special to us in this book; a little off-the-radar and even underappreciated, part of our motivation for writing this book was to draw attention to these hidden gems.",

It’s a little out-of-the-way; in some ways, this trail feels farther than some destinations in the Smokies. It’s worth it for a great family hike with kids of all ages.

    "text": "The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited National Park in the United States, recently an astonishing 14 million visitors per year. It’s an astonishing place — high mountain ridges with plants reminiscent of the northern United States and even Canada; river and creek beds with abundant aquatic wildlife; a place of wild bears and stories and the history of both Cherokee and European settlers still present. There’s no way around these hikes being the heart of this book. That is not meant to diminish those close to Knoxille and the Cumberland Plateau, which in other parts of the country would stand apart as destinations in their own right. It just speaks to how special the Smokies can be.\nThat said, a note and a warning. Many hikes in the Smokies that are featured in this book are an hour — some a little more, and others a little less — from Knoxville. The high number of visitors and the proximity of Knoxville have key implications for families: you can be choosy about when and where to go! While there are few things more special than a Smokies hike up, for example, a beautiful creek on a perfect Fall day, there are few things more challenging than being stuck in traffic, no trail in sight, with tired out kid, or ending up on a trail that feels more like a line at nearby Dollywood than a hike in the woods. But, this is the benefit of living in Knoxville, and even in the height of the summer, there are trails to visit—and times to visit—that will surprise you with how few people there are! So, both our trails and recommendations about them emphasize not the best trails in general, but those that are best suited for family hikes.",

It’s close to many amenities, and the drive from Knoxville is doable in a day. The hike starts at the Little River trailhead, following the Little River along its namesake river. Turn around near the small waterfall or continue the loop back to the trailhead. Great for kids of all ages because there is not any one spot you must reach on the trail; hike as far as you like and then head back to the start to picnic or check out the historic cabins!\n\n\n\n27.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nElkmont Campground, MC58+3H Gatlinburg, Tennessee\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.65346, -83.58005\n\n\n\nThe trailhead address includes a “Plus code” to park at the start of the Little River Trail — that parking area does not have a specific address.

The creek that this trail follows looks otherwordly - clear and almost turquoise in color. This hike starts at a trailhead at the Big Creek Picnic Area — beside the Big Creek Campground. The trail starts off a little steep, but the trail is wide and smooth; like the Middle Prong trail, this trail used to be a railroad bed. The trail follows above the creek and then returns closer to it, with Mouse Creek Falls as the turn-around.

It’s a joy in mid-late April, depending on the year’s weather. This hike starts on the kid-friendly Schoolhouse Gap trail and then connects to the Whiteoak Sink trail, which is a bit rockier but still hike-able by younger children. You may notice that Whiteoak Sink does not appear on the National Park Service trail map for the Smokies; technically, Whiteoak Sink is not an official trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the key takeaway for hikers is to respect this unique area of the park by staying on the trail and refraining to pick wildflowers. It is a must-hike during wildflower season, but also worth a trip outside of that elusive spring period. Because of the length, best for younger kids who are carried some or all of the way, or kids who are comfortable with a longer hike.\n\n\n\n29.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nSchoolhouse Gap Trailhead, J7GF+W9, Townsend, TN 37882\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.62718, -83.72650\n\n\n\nThe above address is for the parking area beside the trail.

Enter the part of the trail with the densest understory of wildflowers. Tread carefully; stay on the trail to not damage any of the plants near to the trail.\n\n\n2.35\nReach the large bat cave ahead of the end of the trail. Still tread carefully (and do not attempt to enter the caves for your safety and to not endanger the bats). Optionally, turn right or left to explore more of this special area. Then, turn around to return along the trail you took into Whiteoak Sink. Return to the start.\n\n\n4.6\nTrailhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.0.5 Nearby\n\nExploring the Cades Cove loop. A drive around the Cades Cove Loop can complement a hike to Whiteoak Sink. We recommend only driving this beautiful loop road outside of the busiest times (summer and fall weekends and holidays, mainly) when traffic can be intense. Consult the Abrams Fall hike for additional details on this area and nearby amenities.\nVisiting Townsend. Like the Chestnut Tops hike, visiting “The Peaceful Side of the Smokies,” Townsend, is a great way to end this trip to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\nHiking the West Prong Trail. The nearby West Prong Trail is a favorite that didn’t quite make it into this book, but it is still a worthy destination. Instead of hiking up Schoolhouse Gap (like for this trail), cross the road and hike to the scenic backpacking site #18 as the turn-around spot beside a wood log bridge and pretty creek.",

A benefit of this hike is its distance–only 0.6 miles to the waterfall, but along a stream that affords many chances to hop in and splash. The turn-around spot is an overlook to a waterfall, Lynn Camp Prong, though the trail continues after the cascades up to another waterfall, Indian Flats Falls. Given the ample shade and easy access to the stream, this is a great hike for the summer, but it is enjoyable in all seasons.

Please note it uses a “Plus code” in lieu of a stree address that only works in Google Maps. Note that this trailhead is at the end of a lengthy gravel road, but it’s fairly smooth (and it’s a pretty drive). This is a large parking area. Even on the busiest days, you will be able to find a place to park. There are spots around the turn-around, but, if they are taken, it is acceptable to park on the side of the road. After parking, walk toward the bridge to start your hike.\n\n\n30.0.4 Trail Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from Start\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0.0\nCross the bridge over Lynn Camp Prong.

Though a short way in, this is an acceptable spot to turn around and head back to the start. The trail continues onward.

This is a nice way to make a longer day of your trip. Instead of returning the way you came, at the intersection of Townsend Road and Laurel Creek Road, turn left and head toward Cade’s Cove. The drive to Cade’s Cove is around 15 minutes; the loop road around Cade’s Cove takes around 45 minutes to drive–longer on busy days, especially when bears are visible–which is often! Traffic on the loop road can be severe, especially during peak times, so plan accordingly to avoid restless kiddos.\nStopping for a snack or meal in Townsend. Townsend bills itself as the “Peaceful Side of the Smokies”. Peaceful Side Social is a favorite lunch and dinner spot with kids, owing to the good food and large outdoor play area.",

It’s accessible, offers a wide variety of features to please all members of the family, and has the added bonus of being beautiful! The enduring memory from this trail is of kids splashing endlessly in the shallow creeks. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies, and we returned again and again because we always enjoyed our time together there. There are many ways to shorten the hike, and we often hike around a mile in and then turn around. It can be warmer here in the summer months, but the river offers many opportunities to swim and splash around, making it a great destination for the summer as well. This hike is relatively challenging and better suited to hiking with older children, but the beauty of this hike is its versatility.\n\n\n\n31.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nAbrams Creek Campground, J368+MR Tallassee, Tennessee\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.61095, -83.93356\n\n\n\nIt never seems to become crowded at Abrams Creek, but parking can be a bit confusing.

This hike is one of the closest to Knoxville. Furthermore, it is close to the amenities of Townsend — a far quieter town than Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. The trail starts with a steep climb until it reaches a rocky point that is a great stopping point; we always grab a snack here, and kiddos like to hike on or around the rocks. The trail continues along the trail past pretty mountain laurel, typically in bloom around mid-May through early June, stopping at a fun but somewhat arbitrary point - a hollow tree! Continue farther if you like, or head back to the start and the Townsend Wye, a great picnic and water play spot. Best for kids who are comfortable with a steady climb.\n\n\n\n33.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nTownsend Wye, Laurel Creek Rd & Little River Rd, Townsend, TN 37882\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.66027, -83.70839\n\n\n\nThis address is for the Townsend Wye, a prominent intersection between Townsend, the road to Gatlinburg (Little River Gorge Rd.), and the road to Cades Cove (Laurel Creek Road) and one of the best-known summer swimming spots in the Smokies.

    "text": "34.0.1 Overview\nThis is a classic Smokies hike along the scenic Abrams Creek, ending in an epic waterfall. The only downside? You must drive (or, on Wednesdays in the summer, bike!) through Cades Cove to get to the trailhead, and Cades Cove is often busy. We recommend either being prepared for extensive traffic in Cades Cove or visiting during the week or outside of the busy warm weather weekends. With that caveat in mind, we recommend this as a true day-long family adventure worthy of a visit. The trail starts at a scenic trailhead near the intersection of two pretty creeks. it hikes through the piney forest, climbing a little at a few points. Abrams Falls is a wonderful spot for a lengthy picnic before returning to the start. Best for older children or younger children who are carried when their little legs get tired.\n\n\n\n34.0.2 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nAbrams Falls Trailhead, H4RW+CX Townsend, Tennessee\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.59129, -83.85233\n\n\n\n:—– | :—– |\n\n\n | |\n\n\nxx\n\n\n34.0.3 Trail Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from Start\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0.0\nBegin at the Abrams Falls Trailhead.

The Cades Cove Visitor Center (5686 Cades Cove Loop Rd, Townsend, TN 37882) up the road is a store, but it also abuts several nearby historical structures that are worth a visit)—the Cades Cove Historical Grist Mill and the John P Cable Drive Thru Barn (that you walk, rather than drive, to and through!). Try to find your way to Mill Creek to cool off in warm weather.\nStopping at historic cabins and scenic lookouts. Though it can be busy with traffic, especially during peak visitation periods (summer and fall weekends, in particular), a drive through Cades Cove is punctuated with numerous opportunities to stop at historic cabins and scenic lookouts. Plus, much of the year, you and others will stop to see wildlife—deer, turkey, and often bears!\nBike the Cades Cove Loop. Biking the Cades Cove Loop on car-free Wednesdays during the summer and into the early fall is a classic Smokies activity. We know it’s a lot for kids to bike (or be carried out on a bike) and to hike, so this may be best as a separate day trip.",

Kuwohi is the highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park — the highest point in Tennessee and among the highest in the Eastern United States. Why Andrews Bald instead of Kuwohi? The path to Kuwohi is often exceptionally crowded. It is still worth a visit, but Andrews Bald is as or more exceptional in some ways: instead of reaching a crowded overlook, Andrews Bald is a grassy bald overlooking layers of mountains. Pair it with a trip to Kuwohi or a stop at Newfound Gap, perhaps catching sunset after an afternoon hike to Andrews Bald. One memorable experience for us: we saw a bear on this trail, our first as a family. The hike has some rocky elements, and it can be lengthy, so we recommend this hike for older children.\n\n\n\n35.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nKuwohi Trailhead, HG43+QG Bryson City, North Carolina\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.55680, -83.49617\n\n\n\nThe above address is for the trailhead for Kuwohi—formerly named Clingman’s Dome until renamed to its traditional name to the Cherokee, Kuwohi. in 2023. Parking here can be difficult to find during busy periods (especially during the summer, during breaks, and on weekends during the fall).\nConsider visiting outside of these busy periods to avoid being stuck waiting to find a spot. After finding a spot, walk toward the Kuwohi Visitor Center. Look for the signs for the Forney Ridge Trail (it’s just a few feet to the left along the same path as the Kuwohi Trail).\n\n\n35.0.4 Trail Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from Start\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0.01\nStart on the Forney Ridge Trail.\n\n\n0.2\nIntersection with the Kuwohi Bypass Trail.

Nearby Kuwohi and the Kuwohi Trail to access this peak feature an observation tower with views in all directions. There’s also the nearby Kuwhohi Visitor Center. Both the trail and visitor center share the same parking area.\nStopping at Newfound Gap. On the way to Andrews Bald, you passed Newfound Gap—the mountain pass and scenic overlook atop the state line between Tennessee and North Carolina. This is a good place to stop for photos or a brief (or lengthier!) hike on the Appalachian Trail that runs through the parking lot—and toward the popular scenic overlook Charlie’s Bunion, a steep, challenging eight-mile round-trip hike from Newfound Gap.",

The trail starts at a pretty trailhead along Highway 441, the main road through the park. The trail continues along the super scenic Alum Cave Creek; the trail is very well-maintained and easily hiked by younger children. The trail climbs through a unique geological feature you hike through, Arch Rock, then heads up more steeply toward Mt. LeConte. The trail then crosses an overlook surrounded by Mountain Laurel before climbing farther toward Alum Cave, yet another unique geological feature, Alum Cave, you hike beneath. It’s epic. This is a perfect spot for a rest and a picnic before returning to the trailhead. This is a challenging hike, and finding parking can also be a challenge, but it is worth the investment of time and effort, particularly for older kids or little kids looking for a big challenge.\n\n\n\n36.0.3 Directions to the Trailhead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead Address\nAlum Cave Trailhead Parking Area, 3639 Newfound Gap Rd, Gatlinburg, TN 37738\n\n\n\n\nTrailhead GPS Coordinates\n35.62872, -83.45076\n\n\n\nThis is one of the busiest parking areas and trailheads in the park. Particularly with children, visiting during periods that are less busy can be essential for quickly finding a spot. Apart from visiting outside of busy periods, arriving in the early-mid afternoon can be a good time, as many who arrived in the morning are departing. Try to park at one of the two parking areas immediately beside the trailhead (one alongside the road, the other near the seasonal toilet). If you cannot, other parking is available, but from those you have to walk along the side of the road to reach the trailhead. If two or more adults are present, consider dropping children off with one adult, while the other finds a spot. After finding a spot, look for the signs for the Alum Cave Trail.\n\n\n36.0.4 Trail Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from Start\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0.0\nStart on the Alum Cave Trail. Almost immediately cross a bridge over the West Prong of the Little Pigeon River.\n\n\n0.1\nContinue on the trail, now along Alum Cave Creek. The trail gradually climbs up a wide, scenic pathway, occasionally crossing\n\n\n0.6\nFun spots to splash in the creek abound around this section. Pick one and cool off in warmer weather!\n\n\n1.3\nCross a bridge and then climb up the stairs through Arch Rock. This is an optional point at which to turn-around and return to the start.\n\n\n1.4\nCross a footlog and enter a different part of the hike, one where you will ascend more steeply (though the trail remains moderately steep here).\n\n\n1.9\nReach inspiration point, a rocky prominence and scenic overlook — and a great point to pause or return back to the start, though the bluffs are only a bit further.\n\n\n2.2\nSteep climb up stairs. Almost there!\n\n\n2.25\nAlum Cave Bluffs. Rest, soak in the views, and get ready for the return hike (almost all downhill!). The trail to Mount LeConte continues past the bluffs.\n\n\n4.5\nTrailhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36.0.5 Nearby\n\nVisit Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg. Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg loosely form a corridor from I-40 to the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Sevierville and (especially) Pigeon Forge feature tourist attractions, restaurants, and a very wide variety of shops; Gatlinburg is touristy but has a more small-town character. As tourist destinations, all three can be busy, but they can be fun places to stop with happy but tired kiddos.\nHiking on to LeConte for a grand adventure! You may continue farther along on the Alum Cave Trail to Mount LeConte, a peak with only around 40 feet less height than Kuwohi, but only accessible via (lengthy) hikes—the roundtrip hike from the Alum Cave Trail Trailhead to Mount LeConte is around 11 very challenging miles. There is a lodge at which you can reserve a rustic room—LeConte Lodge (LeConte Lodge · Gatlinburg, TN 37738)—but it can be difficult to secure a reservation. The LeConte Lodge includes a store at which day hikers can purchase snacks, coveted t-shirts, and even more coveted no-bake cookies.",
