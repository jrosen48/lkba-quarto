    "text": "A Story About a Hike\nFirst comes the vision. A beautiful sunny day out in nature with your family. Your young children happily throwing rocks in rivers, wading in creeks. Oh, look! Little JoJo caught a crawdad! A picnic where everyone enjoys the food and nobody complains because you made the peanut butter and jelly on the dark brown bread (otherwise known as wheat). You cover extensive ground! Your children bask in nature! You get gorgeous pictures to share on social media. Then, the kiddos nap peacefully on the ride home while you and your spouse agree on what music or podcast to listen to.\nRecord Scratch\nSure, we’d all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is a bit messier, potentially whinier (which comes with the territory when doing activities with young kids), and comes with unexpected bumps in the road (also known as surprises, depending on how you look at these kinds of things).\nIn reality, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even leave your house. Packing for a day hike seems like it should be simple, but by the time you consider what your family will need and plan properly for the trail you’ll be spending time on, you’ve already expended a lot of mental energy and can’t muster up the patience for the car ride to the trailhead.\nOnce you arrive, the kids are hungry for the forty-third time, the baby falls and scrapes her knee and refuses to go in the carrier pack, and your oldest can’t be pulled away from the creek just beyond the trailhead to even start the hike.\nWe’ve been there more times than we can count, and have felt more relief in a hike being over than we felt excitement to go on the hike in the first place. However, we’ve also grown as a family who hikes, honed in on the process, adjusted our expectations, and have built some beautiful memories in the process.\nIf you’re a family who enjoys the outdoors, wants to enjoy the outdoors, and wants to learn more about the family hike adventures that await you, this guide is for you. In this guide, we’ll provide hiking and gear recommendations, all designed with young families in mind.",

    "text": "What this Book is About (and Why We Wrote It)\nWhile we are rooted now, when we moved to Knoxville with a little one – our little one was only 3 months old – we (understandably) found it hard to find our place in our new home. Our first trip to Ijams helped us to feel like we knew where to go for a weekend expedition. We added Lakeshore and House Mountain. A camping trip to Frozen Head State Park opened our eyes: this place is special! Later, our first trip to the Smokies sealed the deal: we loved it here. As we transitioned from newcomers to those welcoming new friends, we were increasingly asked a question:\nWhere should we go to hike?\nThis book is meant to be our answer – for our friends and for you. It’s also a reflection of our love for the areas around Knoxville, where we have been lucky to have experiences as a family and with our friends that we cherish.\n\n\nWho this Book is For\nWell, are you looking for family-friendly hikes in or near Knoxville? Then this book is for you! We worked hard to be laser focused on that task. Several great books on hiking in Knoxville or its surroundings exist (we detail some of our favorites in Chapter XX). This book is for families and others caring for children who are looking for an accessible introduction to the outdoors that spares no excitement.\nWe have been lucky to have watch our oldest child grow from a three-month-old to (at the time of writing) a seven-year-old since we moved to Knoxville, and the hikes we have sought out and enjoyed have – naturally – changed over time. Furthermore, from the time we proposed this book (in 2022) until when we completed it (in 2025), we welcomed our daughter in 2023, changing the game in terms of what trails we hiked, and when and how we did.\nThus, we are sensitive to how what counts as a family-friendly hike is likely different at different times – and what we consider to be family-friendly differs (even between us as co-authors; cough cough, Josh!). For these reasons, we included a wide range of hikes, from those shorter than a mile on paved trails to epic expeditions into the Smokies. In sum, we took care to describe the hikes in ways that will allow you to choose those that are the best for you.\nWe’ll share a little bit more in Chapter XXX, but we included hikes that are suitable for the youngest of children (infants who are pushed in strollers or carried in child carriers) up through pre-teens, reasoning that plucky teenagers could consult general hiking guides for the most challenging hikes.\n\n\nWhere the Hikes Are\nAll of the hikes are near Knoxville, from just a few minutes to within an hour or two drive (but no longer). In accordance with our focus on hiking with younger children, most of the hikes are within an hour’s drive of Knoxville. We categorize the hikes into three regions:\n\nIn and around Knoxville: Hikes within the Knoxville city limits, to those within a 30-minute drive.\nThe Cumberland Plateau: An often under-appreciated but fantastic region of rock outcroppings and wild rivers to the West and North of Knoxville. The hikes in this book are from around one to two hours from Knoxville, with most being close to one hour.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park: The most-visited and the most biodiverse national park—right in Knoxville’s backyard. These are mostly around an hour from Knoxville, though a few are closer to two hours.\n\n\n\nWhen to Go?\nA feature of the outdoors around Knoxville is that it is absolutely possible to hike in all seasons — especially with a little care taken with respect to which trails you visit when. Some hikes are very hot in the summer; others are cold in the winter. A benefit of the variety of being close to both the hiking areas in and around Knoxville and those in the Cumberland Plateau and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park—the Smokies—is that you can be choosy about which you visit. Furthermore, you can be picky about when you visit those trails that can get busy (typically, well-known trails in the Smokies), and so we offer guidance about when to visit those trails for which good timing can make a difference between a great family hike and a (literal) traffic jam.",

    "text": "“Best hikes” lists may not be the best for families\nMany lists of the best hikes around Knoxville (and other areas) exist. These lists feature fantastic hikes: challenging, scenic, and worth visiting. However, these hikes are often very popular, which can lead to congested trails. Furthermore, some of the hikes on lists of the best hikes in an area may be far away—from you and amenities. Worst of all, they may be in areas with lots of traffic, and clogged trailheads where you cannot find a spot.\nThus, the best family-friend hike around Knoxville may be different from the best hike: who wants to drive for hours, get stuck in traffic, and end up on a too-busy trail — especially with little ones? This leads to the following question, then:\nWhat’s the best family-friendly hike around Knoxville?\n\n\nThe best family-friendly hike is . . .\nIn our experience, it can be really hard to predict which when and where we’ll have a great time. Sometimes we have picked out a popular hike, but ended up disappointed by crowds and stressful drives there and back. Other times, we have picked out a trail near downtown Knoxville and a whim and have been delighted.\nThus, we think the best family-friendly hike around Knoxville is where your family has the best experiences. Parents and caregivers know how this works in other places and at other times: kids receive a holiday gift, and they end up playing in the cardboard boxes. The best family-friendly hike is the one where your family has the best experiences and makes the best memories and stories to tell after. Thus, the best hike is not necessarily the one with the best views, the highest waterfall, or the terrain that is the most challenging to you or your little ones.\nThat said, the hikes in this book are those on which we have had good experiences. We think those in this book offer great “bang for your buck”. While some of them are very popular, others are far less well-known. We tried to recommend the hikes that are in the sweet spot for parents of younger children: not too far away, not so challenging so as to be discouraging to kids and their parents; near amenities; and being scenic, challenging, and rewarding.\n\n\nFinding the best hike for your family\nApart from considering the time of the year and the weather (always important!), here are some questions that we think it can be useful to consider before planning a hike:\n\nHow far do we want to drive?\nHow much time do we have to hike?\nHow much of a challenge are our children—and how much of a challenge are we—looking for?\n\nAnswering these questions can help you to locate trails nearer or farther; shorter or longer; and which hike has the best degree of challenge for your little.\nEach trail in this book includes the approximate driving distance from Knoxville (XXX - make sure to add when editing the tables), the length of the hike, and for which ages the hike is best. Check those out!\nLastly, if you’re looking for some inspiration, we have created top five lists for different features of trails in Chapter XX.\n\n\nHow to use this book\nThis book is organized into the three regions we mentioned in the last chapter – in and around Knoxville, the Cumberland Plateau, and the Great Smoky Mountains National park.\nWithin each section, we ordered the trails loosely along the lines of those we’d recommend first to friends looking for a pointer for where to go. Thus, the first few hikes in each section are what we think of as sure bets — get the weather right, pack a bunch of snacks, and we think you’ll likely have a good time. The other hikes are also great, but they might have some features that make them a bit more challenging or more particular in terms of when you need to visit to avoid the crowds.\nEach hike includes a brief overview, key characteristics, a trail description, directions to the trailhead. We also include a map of the trail, and a note about what’s nearby.\nThe trail maps should be pretty straightforward to use; the trailheads are marked with a green dot, and the trail is in red, with key features of the trail noted along the way. There are symbols for parking areas, restrooms, scenic overlooks, waterfalls, and other amenities, like playgrounds and picnic areas.\nSee you on the trails! If you’re looking for a few more pointers, check out the next chapter — on considerations for your first hike.",

    "text": "You do not need much specialized gear to go on your first hike. Indeed, select a particular hike at a particular time, and you will not need anything particular at all. We detail those considerations: selecting a particular hike at a particular time and a few other things that are needed on practically every hike.\n\nDefine your own adventure.\nDo you need a hike that will help burn older kids’ energy? Or do you have toddlers who simply want to touch every leaf and rock you pass? Decide what’s most important for your family hike and pick a trail that best supports that!\n\n\nGive kids’ time.\nWant to encourage your kids to love hiking and being outside? Let them develop their own interests and explore their own curiosities when you go on a hike. Sometimes this might mean playing in a creek for half of your planned hiking time.\n\n\n\nPlan for the basics.\nTake a look at the weather for the area or region you’re hiking, get a gauge on the terrain, and wear or pack appropriate clothes and shoes. Oh, and snacks. Lots of snacks!\n\n\nPlan for a mess.\nWhen a kiddo plods through a creek, it sure is nice to have a backup pair of socks and shoes! Sometimes, an emergency change of clothes packed in your bag or in your car can come in handy. Some bandaids or a basic first aid kit is always nice to have in a pinch and, in general, bring more water than you think you’ll need, because you never know!\n!\n\n\nEmbrace serendipity.\nIt’s good to have a plan, but don’t be surprised if something better comes along! Maybe you hike further than you thought you would, or perhaps your child surprises you (and themselves!) by taking some time to rock hop across a creek or explore animal tracks.",

    "text": "These hikes are within or near Knoxville, in what is often referred to as the Tennessee Valley. The Tennessee Valley includes Knoxville and many other cities that border the mountains that surround Knoxville. This area is known as the Tennessee Valley because of its primary geographic feature: The Tennessee River.\nThe Tennessee River begins just beyond the city limits of Knoxville, where the Holston and the French Broad Rivers meet. It (literally and figuratively!) contains fewer high points than the Cumberland Plateau and the Great Smoky Mountains, but, it should not be discounted as a destination for hiking.\nWe think a trip to Seven Islands State Birding Park will make how spectactular this area can be evident. Around 30 minutes away from most places in Knoxville, this is a true destination for not only birders, but also hikers and paddlers.\nOther locations are also not only close, but (surprisingly) worthy of a trip. Ijams on the south side of Knoxville–familiar to many in the Knoxville area–has many spectacular features, in addition to being fewer than ten minutes away from downtown.\nOther places that we highlight are also worth your time, offering an outdoors respite in addition to the ability to easily be integrated into busy schedules and other commitments. If you are looking for a first family hike, those in this section may make a great selection.",

This hike is a crowd pleaser for every family member of all ages thanks to a paved path that makes bringing babies in a stroller a breeze and easy acces to experience meadow, woodland, and a river! For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a meadow. Look for varied bird varieties and deer in all seasons! The trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and then a dirt trail make a loop around a beautiful island before returning back to the paved path.

    "text": "The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited National Park in the United States, recently an astonishing 14 million visitors per year. It’s an astonishing place — high mountain ridges with plants reminiscent of the northern United States and even Canada; river and creek beds with abundant aquatic wildlife; a place of wild bears and stories and the history of both Cherokee and European settlers still present. There’s no way around these hikes being the heart of this book. That is not meant to diminish those close to Knoxille and the Cumberland Plateau, which in other parts of the country would stand apart as destinations in their own right. It just speaks to how special the Smokies can be.\nThat said, a note and a warning. Many hikes in the Smokies that are featured in this book are an hour — some a little more, and others a little less — from Knoxville. The high number of visitors and the proximity of Knoxville have key implications for families: you can be choosy about when and where to go! While there are few things more special than a Smokies hike up, for example, a beautiful creek on a perfect Fall day, there are few things more challenging than being stuck in traffic, no trail in sight, with tired out kid, or ending up on a trail that feels more like a line at nearby Dollywood than a hike in the woods. But, this is the benefit of living in Knoxville, and even in the height of the summer, there are trails to visit—and times to visit—that will surprise you with how few people there are! So, both our trails and recommendations about them emphasize not the best trails in general, but those that are best suited for family hikes.",

    "text": "Overview\nThis hike is a great introduction to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park by featuring a bit of many of the elements that make the Smokies special — a trail along a beautiful, clear river; a waterfall; abundant plant and aquatic wildlife; deep forest; and human history in the form of historic cabins. It’s close to many amenities, and the drive from Knoxville is doable in a day. The hike starts at the Little River trailhead, following the Little River along its namesake river. Turn around near the small waterfall or continue the loop back to the trailhead.

The creek that this trail follows looks otherwordly - clear and almost turquoise in color. This hike starts at a trailhead at the Big Creek Picnic Area — beside the Big Creek Campground. The trail starts off a little steep, but the trail is wide and smooth; like the Middle Prong trail, this trail used to be a railroad bed. The trail follows above the creek and then returns closer to it, with Mouse Creek Falls as the turn-around.

This hike starts on the kid-friendly Schoolhouse Gap trail and then connects to the Whiteoak Sink trail, which is a bit rockier but still hike-able by younger children. You may notice that Whiteoak Sink does not appear on the National Park Service trail map for the Smokies; technically, Whiteoak Sink is not an official trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the key takeaway for hikers is to respect this unique area of the park by staying on the trail and refraining to pick wildflowers. It is a must-hike during wildflower season, but also worth a trip outside of that elusive spring period.

A drive around the Cades Cove Loop can complement a hike to Whiteoak Sink. We recommend only driving this beautiful loop road outside of the busiest times (summer and fall weekends and holidays, mainly) when traffic can be intense. Consult the Abrams Fall hike for additional details on this area and nearby amenities.\nVisiting Townsend. Like the Chestnut Tops hike, visiting “The Peaceful Side of the Smokies,” Townsend, is a great way to end this trip to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\nHiking the West Prong Trail. The nearby West Prong Trail is a favorite that didn’t quite make it into this book, but it is still a worthy destination. Instead of hiking up Schoolhouse Gap (like for this trail), cross the road and hike to the scenic backpacking site #18 as the turn-around spot beside a wood log bridge and pretty creek.",

Traffic on the loop road can be severe, especially during peak times, so plan accordingly to avoid restless kiddos.\nStopping for a snack or meal in Townsend.

The Cades Cove Visitor Center (5686 Cades Cove Loop Rd, Townsend, TN 37882) up the road is a store, but it also abuts several nearby historical structures that are worth a visit)—the Cades Cove Historical Grist Mill and the John P Cable Drive Thru Barn (that you walk, rather than drive, to and through!). Try to find your way to Mill Creek to cool off in warm weather.\nStopping at historic cabins and scenic lookouts. Though it can be busy with traffic, especially during peak visitation periods (summer and fall weekends, in particular), a drive through Cades Cove is punctuated with numerous opportunities to stop at historic cabins and scenic lookouts. Plus, much of the year, you and others will stop to see wildlife—deer, turkey, and often bears!\nBike the Cades Cove Loop. Biking the Cades Cove Loop on car-free Wednesdays during the summer and into the early fall is a classic Smokies activity. We know it’s a lot for kids to bike (or be carried out on a bike) and to hike, so this may be best as a separate day trip.",

    "text": "Overview\nAndrews Bald is the under-rated twin to Kuwohi (formerly known as Clingman’s Dome). Kuwohi is the highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park — the highest point in Tennessee and among the highest in the Eastern United States. Why Andrews Bald instead of Kuwohi? The path to Kuwohi is often exceptionally crowded. It is still worth a visit, but Andrews Bald is as or more exceptional in some ways: instead of reaching a crowded overlook, Andrews Bald is a grassy bald overlooking layers of mountains. Pair it with a trip to Kuwohi or a stop at Newfound Gap, perhaps catching sunset after an afternoon hike to Andrews Bald. One memorable experience for us: we saw a bear on this trail, our first as a family. The hike has some rocky elements, and it can be lengthy, so we recommend this hike for older children.\n\n\n\nKey Characteristics\n\n\n\nTrail Name\nAndrews Bald\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n\nTrail #\n27\n\n\nTime Estimate - Hiking Fast\n2 hours\n\n\nTime Estimate - Hiking Slowly\n3.5 hours\n\n\nTrail Distance (Miles)\n3.6\n\n\nElevation Change\nModerate\n\n\nPets\nNot Allowed\n\n\nParking Pass/Entrance Fee\nRequired\n\n\nRestroom(s)\nYes (seasonal)\n\n\nTerrain\nDirt path; rocky path\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirections to the Trailhead\nTrailhead Address: Kuwohi Trailhead, HG43+QG Bryson City, North Carolina Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 35.55680, -83.49617\nThe above address is for the trailhead for Kuwohi—formerly named Clingman’s Dome until renamed to its traditional name to the Cherokee, Kuwohi. in 2023. Parking here can be difficult to find during busy periods (especially during the summer, during breaks, and on weekends during the fall).\nConsider visiting outside of these busy periods to avoid being stuck waiting to find a spot. After finding a spot, walk toward the Kuwohi Visitor Center.

On the way to Andrews Bald, you passed Newfound Gap—the mountain pass and scenic overlook atop the state line between Tennessee and North Carolina. This is a good place to stop for photos or a brief (or lengthier!) hike on the Appalachian Trail that runs through the parking lot—and toward the popular scenic overlook Charlie’s Bunion, a steep, challenging eight-mile round-trip hike from Newfound Gap.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis is a hike up arguably the finest trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The trail starts at a pretty trailhead along Highway 441, the main road through the park. The trail continues along the super scenic Alum Cave Creek; the trail is very well-maintained and easily hiked by younger children. The trail climbs through a unique geological feature you hike through, Arch Rock, then heads up more steeply toward Mt. LeConte. The trail then crosses an overlook surrounded by Mountain Laurel before climbing farther toward Alum Cave, yet another unique geological feature, Alum Cave, you hike beneath. It’s epic. This is a perfect spot for a rest and a picnic before returning to the trailhead. This is a challenging hike, and finding parking can also be a challenge, but it is worth the investment of time and effort, particularly for older kids or little kids looking for a big challenge.\n\n\n\nKey Characteristics\n\n\n\nTrail Name\nAlum Cave\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n\nTrail #\n28\n\n\nTime Estimate - Hiking Fast\n3 hours\n\n\nTime Estimate - Hiking Slowly\n5 hours\n\n\nTrail Distance (Miles)\n4.5\n\n\nElevation Change\nVery Steep\n\n\nPets\nNot Allowed\n\n\nParking Pass/Entrance Fee\nRequired\n\n\nRestroom(s)\nYes (seasonal)\n\n\nTerrain\nDirt path; rocky path; rock steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirections to the Trailhead\nTrailhead Address: Alum Cave Trailhead Parking Area, 3639 Newfound Gap Rd, Gatlinburg, TN 37738 Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 35.62872, -83.45076\nThis is one of the busiest parking areas and trailheads in the park. Particularly with children, visiting during periods that are less busy can be essential for quickly finding a spot. Apart from visiting outside of busy periods, arriving in the early-mid afternoon can be a good time, as many who arrived in the morning are departing. Try to park at one of the two parking areas immediately beside the trailhead (one alongside the road, the other near the seasonal toilet). If you cannot, other parking is available, but from those you have to walk along the side of the road to reach the trailhead. If two or more adults are present, consider dropping children off with one adult, while the other finds a spot. After finding a spot, look for the signs for the Alum Cave Trail.\n\n\nTrail Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance from Start\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0.0\nStart on the Alum Cave Trail. Almost immediately cross a bridge over the West Prong of the Little Pigeon River.\n\n\n0.1\nContinue on the trail, now along Alum Cave Creek. The trail gradually climbs up a wide, scenic pathway, occasionally crossing\n\n\n0.6\nFun spots to splash in the creek abound around this section. Pick one and cool off in warmer weather!\n\n\n1.3\nCross a bridge and then climb up the stairs through Arch Rock. This is an optional point at which to turn-around and return to the start.\n\n\n1.4\nCross a footlog and enter a different part of the hike, one where you will ascend more steeply (though the trail remains moderately steep here).\n\n\n1.9\nReach inspiration point, a rocky prominence and scenic overlook — and a great point to pause or return back to the start, though the bluffs are only a bit further.\n\n\n2.2\nSteep climb up stairs. Almost there!\n\n\n2.25\nAlum Cave Bluffs. Rest, soak in the views, and get ready for the return hike (almost all downhill!). The trail to Mount LeConte continues past the bluffs.\n\n\n4.5\nTrailhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearby\n\nVisit Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg. Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg loosely form a corridor from I-40 to the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Sevierville and (especially) Pigeon Forge feature tourist attractions, restaurants, and a very wide variety of shops; Gatlinburg is touristy but has a more small-town character. As tourist destinations, all three can be busy, but they can be fun places to stop with happy but tired kiddos.\nHiking on to LeConte for a grand adventure! You may continue farther along on the Alum Cave Trail to Mount LeConte, a peak with only around 40 feet less height than Kuwohi, but only accessible via (lengthy) hikes—the roundtrip hike from the Alum Cave Trail Trailhead to Mount LeConte is around 11 very challenging miles. There is a lodge at which you can reserve a rustic room—LeConte Lodge (LeConte Lodge · Gatlinburg, TN 37738)—but it can be difficult to secure a reservation. The LeConte Lodge includes a store at which day hikers can purchase snacks, coveted t-shirts, and even more coveted no-bake cookies.",
