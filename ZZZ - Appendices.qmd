## Leave No Trace: Keeping the Wilderness Wild
These help preserve outdoor spaces for future adventurers. 

### 1. Plan Ahead and Prepare
Check weather conditions before you go, and consider checking the website for the area you'll be hiking in to ensure the trail is open and in good condition (the vast majority of the time, trails are open!). Pack appropriate gear and extra supplies, especially since you'll be hiking with littles.

### 2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces
Whenever possible, keep to established trails and campsites (we know one of our little hikers had a different tip in an earlier chapter!). Walk single file down the middle of the path - this protects trailside plants and prevents unnecessary erosion. When camping, look for hard, dry ground or existing sites that can handle the impact.

### 3. Pack It In, Pack It Out
Everything you bring must leave with you - food scraps, hygiene products, all of it. For bathroom breaks, if you can't make it to a bathroom, look to go at least 200 feet from water sources. For number #2, try to dig a hole to prevent run off.

### 4. Leave What You Find
The outdoors is full of treasures. Admire them, photograph them, but it's best to leave them where they are.

### 5. Minimize Campfire Impact
If you need or want to have a fire (when camping), use established rings or fire pans. Keep it small, stick to local dead wood, and ensure it's completely cold before you leave.

### 6. Respect Wildlife
Watch animals from a distance - no following, no feeding, no disturbing their homes. Store food securely and keep garbage out of reach. If you bring a doggy, keep them under control and away from wildlife.

### 7. Be Considerate
The wilderness is for everyone. One small part of trail etiquette is to yield to those hiking _up_ on a trail (it's okay and understandable if little ones don't consistently do this, but it's a nice start to mention to those who are older!).
