## Join and Give Back

You may wish to join organizations that advocate for outdoors areas, or give back through donating time or money. Here are some ways to do so.

### Join local organizations

- *Friends of the Smokies* (https://friendsofthesmokies.org/): Works with the National Park Service to advocate for the Smokies
- *Smokies Life* (https://smokieslife.org/): Previously the Great Smoky Mountains Association; manages the stores throughout the park; can purchase parking permits for the National Park at those stores or online through their website
- *Smoky Mountains Hiking Club* (https://www.smhclub.org/): A longstanding hiking club that organizes multiple hikes in every month of the year

### Visit local outdoors education centers

- *Ijams* (https://www.ijams.org/): A nature center with a variety of programs and events
- *Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont* (https://gsmit.org/): A nationally-recognized outdoors and environmental education center located within the National Park; has experiential education programs throughout the year for kids and adults

### Give back

You can donate to all of the above, though participating in their programs or purchasing products from them is a great way to support them. You can also give of your time. Check out volunteering opportunities at Ijams (https://www.ijams.org/volunteer) and for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (https://www.nps.gov/grsm/getinvolved/volunteer.htm); there are a range of opportunities available.

Apart from formally volunteering, be a steward of the trails on which you hike; be sure to leave no trace (see the Appendix for more details), and if you are able, pick up trash from your favorite trails, and move branches or brush off the trail to make the path for the next little hiker a little better.
