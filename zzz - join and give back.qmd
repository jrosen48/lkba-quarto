## Join and Give Back

### Join local organizations

Here are two that advocate for the Smokies:

- Friends of the Smokies (https://friendsofthesmokies.org/)
- Smokies Life (https://smokieslife.org/): can purchase parking permits for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
- Smoky Mountains Hiking Club

### Visit local outdoors education centers

We have two nationally and internationally outdoors education centers nearby, one near Knoxville and one in the Smokies:

- Ijams (https://www.ijams.org/)
- Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont (https://gsmit.org/)

### Give back

You can donate to all of the above, though participating in their programs or purchasing products from them is a great way to support them.

You can also give of time. Check out volunteering opportunities at Ijams and for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 

Apart from formally volunteering, be a steward of the trails on which you hike; be sure to leave no trace, and if you are able, pick up trash from your favorite trails, and move branches or brush off the trail to make the path for the next little hiker a little better.
