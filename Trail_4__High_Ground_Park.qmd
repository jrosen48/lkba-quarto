### Overview

It is one of the closest hikes to the city center of Knoxville --- and one of a few that is highly stroller-friendly.
This short but sweet hike is perfect as a real but accessible outing for toddlers and little kids.
The red chairs at the top are a fun stopping point.
The deep woods are pretty in the fall.
This could be a great first hike for toddlers---it was one of the first for our little one, and we loved how accessible it was.

| 0                   | Start off on the trail with a gentle descent.                                                                                                                                      |
| 0.1                 | Enter the wooded part of the hike and begin a gentle climb.                                                                                                                        |
