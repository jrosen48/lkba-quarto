## Trail 4: High Ground Park

### Overview

This is one of the closest hikes to the city center of Knoxville, and it's stroller-friendly! This short but sweet hike is perfect as a real but accessible outing for toddlers and little kids. The red chairs at the top are a fun stopping point. The deep woods are pretty and offer something new in each season. This could be a great first hike for toddlers – it was one of the first for our little one, and made us feel like we could start venturing to other regional hiking destinations.
