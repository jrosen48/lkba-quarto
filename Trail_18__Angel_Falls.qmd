### Overview

Like a few of the other trails in or near the Cumberland Plateau, this is a spectacular hike that is a little off-the-radar of many in Knoxville. This is a spectacular hike that is a little tricky to get to for a day hike. Still, the view is awesome, rivaling the summits of the Smokies with a different kind of vantage --- here, of the beautiful Big South Fork River. This trail is relatively flat and relatively short, making it appropriate for families with young children. Consider camping at the nearby Bandy Creek campground, and consider this hike a day's excursion from there.

| 0.0                 | Start on the Grand Gap Loop (part of the John Muir Trail - they share a name at this point). Head counterclockwise on the loop trail; the other direction is a much longer way to the overlook. |
| 0.85                | Grave site.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1.4                 | Overlook. Rest and picnic at the large rocky overlook atop the Big South Fork and Angel Falls. Then, turn around to return to the start.                                                        |

### Nearby

-   Stopping by Bandy Creek. Check out the Bandy Creek chapter for more details.
-   Hiking the Angel Falls Trail---and others. The Angel Falls Trail---not to be mistaken with the trail taken to the overlook featured in this hike---starts at the parking area beside the Leatherwood Ford Bridge. It follows the Big South Fork River to conclude with a different---closer---view of Angel Falls, but without the vista from the overlook. Also, the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area has more than 300 miles of trails.
