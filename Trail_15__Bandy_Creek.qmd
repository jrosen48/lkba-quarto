### Overview

A welcoming, gentle introduction to the Big South Fork. Best if you're staying at the campground -- or if you're hiking the nearby Angel Falls Trail or the Fall Branch Falls trails. Starts at the visitor center. This happens to be the flattest trail in the book, and it's a short trail, but it's almost entirely on a dirt path. This is a great hike for toddlers or little kids, and it is good for carried infants.

### Nearby

-   Visiting the horse stables. Kids will likely love the nearby stables that often house many horses ---most from guests at the campground who will ride the trails that allow horses. The nearby Bandy Creek Loop trail is also a good, short hike for young kiddos.
-   Camping at Bandy Creek. This is a large, modern, scenic campground, very much worth a visit, though it is off-the-radar of many. You can almost always find a spot here --- even on holiday weekends.
-   Hiking the Fall Branch Falls or Angel Falls trails. See those chapters for more details.
