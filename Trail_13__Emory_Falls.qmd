### Overview

Writing about this trail makes us smile.
In many ways, it's the perfect kid hike!
It starts at a beautiful trailhead along a pretty creek in the deep woods.
It gradually climbs before stopping at a scenic waterfall, DeBord Falls---one of two, and a perfectly acceptable place to turn around with younger kids (we have many times).
It continues further to Emory Falls before returning on a gradual slope back to the trailhead.
Stop at the playground you passed on the way to the trailhead beside the same creek; the water is usually shallow enough to be perfect for splashing and rock hopping.
Best for kids comfortable with rocky trails.

### Nearby

-   Playing at the playground. There is a fun, shaded creekside playground 0.7 miles down the road from the trailhead; most of the year, the creek is a perfect depth for safe splashing.
-   Checking out the Flat Fork Story Book Trail. Starting near the playground, this short trail is great for the littlest hikers.
-   Hiking to the Frozen Head Mountain Summit. A challenge for the biggest hikers---including adults! This hike is around strenuous seven miles to and back from the Lookout Tower at the summit of Frozen Head Mountain, from which views of the Smokies far in the distance can be faintly visible on clear days.
