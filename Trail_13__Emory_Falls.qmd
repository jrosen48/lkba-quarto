## Trail 13: Emory Falls at Frozen Head

### Overview

Writing about this trail makes us smile. In many ways, it's the perfect kid hike! It starts at a beautiful trailhead along a pretty creek in the deep woods. It gradually climbs before stopping at one of two scenic waterfall, DeBord Falls, and is a perfectly acceptable place to turn around with younger kids (we have many times!). It continues further to Emory Falls before returning on a gradual slope back to the trailhead. Stop at the playground you passed on the way to the trailhead beside the same creek; the water is usually shallow enough to be perfect for splashing and rock hopping. Please note, the trail is rocky, and your kids will likely need reminders to slow down!

#### Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary

A closed prison near Frozen Head State Park is full of lore due to its remote location. Part of the inspiration for the Barkley Marathons (you'll have to look it up if you haven't heard of it). Now a site of a restaurant and distillery.
