### Overview

Another hike that is very close to city center Knoxville, the Knox-Blount Greenway is a fun, easier outing for little walkers and for parents pushing little ones in strollers.
Paved throughout, this trail offers a glimpse of the surprising beauty of the Tennessee River so close to the city.
Our description features a route that heads to the north, toward the city, and then back to the trail from the research park further south before returning to the start; of course, you can hike any way you like!
Look for blue herons and other birds along the side of the river; you might see a Bald Eagle!
Limited shade makes this a great outing for clear but cold winter days but a hot hike during warmer, sunnier times.
This will be a fun hike for a gaggle of kids looking to toddle or run wild!

### Trail Description

| Distance from Start | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| 0.0                 | Walk down the terraced amphitheater.                                                                                                                                  |
| 0.1                 | Begin to descend down a gradual hill.                                                                                                                                 |
| 0.3                 | Reach the river and the Knox-Blount Greenway trail proper. Our route turns right, but you can explore in either direction!                                            |
| 0.35                | Follow the greenway along the river. The meadows to the right are usually mowed; kids may like to cruise through them!                                                |
| 0.8                 | Our preferred route turns around at the intersection of the greenway and a spur trail. Of course, you can continue further if you like. Head back the other direction |
| 1.3                 | Pass the trail from the amphitheater you took earlier, continuing along the river.                                                                                    |
| 1.65                | Turn around at the intersection of another spur trail---or, again, continue further.                                                                                  |
| 2.0                 | Meet back up with the trail to the amphitheater.                                                                                                                      |
| 2.3                 | Traihead.                                                                                                                                                             |

### Nearby

-   Visiting the UT Gardens. The nearby UT Gardens (2621 Morgan Circle, Knoxville, TN 37996) is a great spot for a meander through beautiful gardens. Be sure to check out the Children's Garden featuring grassy moguls kids love to roll or hop down.
-   Biking the greenways. While we featured the Knox-Blount Greenway as a hike, it's also a fun bike ride for young bikers.
