### Overview

Just far enough to be off the radar of many in Knoxville, this trail has a bit of everything - fun bridge crossings, deep forest, waterfalls, and two pretty overlooks.
It does not climb so much as to become tiresome, but it's long enough to feel like a real adventure.
There's something about the Obed area that feels both wild and inviting.
The only downside?
It's a little out-of-the-way; in some ways, this trail feels farther than some destinations in the Smokies.
It's worth it for a great family hike with kids of all ages.
Though out of the way, there are a few fun things to do to extend the hike or to visit very nearby on the way home.
Great for kids of all hiking ages, and not a bad hike on which to carry a little one.

### Nearby

-   Hanging out at Lilly Pad Hopyard Brewery. Befitting the Obed Wild & Scenic Area, the Lilly Pad Hopyard Brewery (<https://www.lillypadhopyardbrewery.com>) is a surprising, fantastic, kid-friendly destination. Stop by for food and drinks---only on Saturday and Sunday from 12-6 pm.
-   Playing around the bouldering area. The Trailhead features a nearby shaded area full of boulders. While we've often used this spot as a peaceful place to finish kiddo naps, older kids love trying to climb the boulders.
