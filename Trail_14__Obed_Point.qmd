## Trail 14: Obed Point Trail

### Overview

Just far enough to be off the radar of many in Knoxville, this trail has a bit of everything - fun bridge crossings, deep forest, waterfalls, and two pretty overlooks. It does not climb so much as to become tiresome, but it's long enough to feel like a real adventure. There's something about the Obed area that feels both wild and inviting. The only downside? It's a little out-of-the-way; in some ways, this trail feels farther than some destinations in the Smokies. It's worth it for a great family hike with kids of all ages. Though out of the way, there are a few fun things to do to extend the hike or to visit very nearby on the way home. Great for kids of all hiking ages, and not a bad hike on which to carry a little one.

#### Bigleaf Magnolia

This tree has the largest simple leaf of any North American tree—one single, undivided leaf! In the fall, its leaves scatter across the ground like pages from a newspaper. You’ll find it common on the Cumberland Plateau, though it’s rare in the Smokies.

### Nearby

-   Hang out at Lilly Pad Hopyard Brewery, only open Saturdays and Sundays, 12-6 p.m. The Lilly Pad Hopyard Brewery (<https://www.lillypadhopyardbrewery.com>) is a surprising, fantastic, kid-friendly destination for food and drinks.
-   Play around the bouldering area. The Trailhead features a nearby shaded area full of boulders. While we've often used this spot as a peaceful place to finish kiddo naps, older kids love trying to climb the boulders.
