## Finding a Hike

Lists of *the best* hikes are helpful, but they can lead you to trails that are far away, crowded, and not suited to young kids. Furthermore, what even is *the best* trail to kids?

We bet you've had the experience on a family trip to someplace special only for your kiddo to be captivated by the stairs near the entrance---or, you bought a pricey gift only for the cardboard box to be the best part.

There's something similar when it comes to finding a hike: Which hike is the best can be really hard to predict in advance!

Still, we think you can set yourself up for success: We picked the hikes that are in the sweet spot for parents of younger children: not too far away, not so challenging so as to be discouraging to kids and their parents; near amenities; and being scenic and rewarding to accomplish.

### Choosing where to hike

Some trails are short, flat, and on a paved surface. Others are longer, steeper, or rockier. How do you find which one is best for you?

This book has three sections, one each for hikes in and around Knoxville, on the Cumberland Plateau, and in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Within each section, we organized loosely along the lines of those we’d recommend first. 

Thus, the first few hikes in each section are what we think of as "sure bets". Get the weather right, pack a bunch of snacks, and we think you’ll likely have a good time. We also created a list of Top 5 Hikes that can help with choosing where to first hike.

For example, Seven Islands in Knoxville is a reliable choice with paved paths, beautiful views, and plenty of spots for kids to explore. Indeed, if you haven't hiked there yet and the weather is good, we recommend you stop reading now and head out!

### Some help with choosing

In addition to the trails at the start of each section, each trail in this book includes an overview and the approximate driving distance from Knoxville, the length of the hike, and for which ages the hike is best. Check those out to find one that's best for you.

Additionally, the chapters include a description, directions to the trailhead. We also include a map of the trail, and a note about what’s nearby. 

We wrote the overviews of each hike with the reader looking to get an overall sense for the "look and feel" of the hike. Skim those for inspiration and ideas. After each overview is a table with key characteristics of the trail, including the approximate distance from Knoxville (calculated from the city center) and for which ages of children the hike is best.

The trail maps should be pretty straightforward to use. Trailheads---the starting points for the hikes---are marked with a green dot, and the trail is in red, with key features of the trail noted along the way. 

The hikes are through areas rich in natural and human history, and while we felt comfortable accurately describing many of these elements, we felt we had to enlist the help of friends and colleagues for others. Note these callouts, many written by those with expertise in the sepcific scientific or historical feature. Look for these in the call-outs in most of the chapters, and consider sharing parts of them with your little hikers.

### Let's go!

That's all---you're ready for your first hike! See you on the trails!
