#  ## Finding a Hike

### “Best hikes” lists may not be the best for families

Many lists of the best hikes around Knoxville (and other areas) exist. These lists feature fantastic hikes: challenging, scenic, and worth visiting. However, these hikes are often very popular, which can lead to congested trails. Furthermore, some of the hikes on lists of the best hikes in an area may be far away—from you and amenities. Worst of all, they may be in areas with lots of traffic, and clogged trailheads where you cannot find a spot.

Thus, the best family-friend hike around Knoxville may be different from the best hike: who wants to drive for hours, get stuck in traffic, and end up on a too-busy trail — especially with little ones? This leads to the following question, then:

*What’s the best family-friendly hike around Knoxville?*

### The best family-friendly hike is . . . 

In our experience, it can be really hard to predict which when and where we’ll have a great time. Sometimes we have picked out a popular hike, but ended up disappointed by crowds and stressful drives there and back. Other times, we have picked out a trail near downtown Knoxville and a whim and have been delighted. 

Thus, we think the *best family-friendly hike around Knoxville* is where your family has the best experiences. Parents and caregivers know how this works in other places and at other times: kids receive a holiday gift, and they end up playing in the cardboard boxes. The best family-friendly hike is the one where your family has the best experiences and makes the best memories and stories to tell after. Thus, the best hike is not necessarily the one with the best views, the highest waterfall, or the terrain that is the most challenging to you or your little ones. 

That said, the hikes in this book are those on which we have had good experiences. We think those in this book offer great “bang for your buck”. While some of them are very popular, others are far less well-known. We tried to recommend the hikes that are in the sweet spot for parents of younger children: not too far away, not so challenging so as to be discouraging to kids and their parents; near amenities; and being scenic, challenging, and rewarding. 

### Start with the first trails in each section

We organized the trails within each section loosely along the lines of those we’d recommend first to friends looking for a pointer for where to go. Thus, the first few hikes in each section are what we think of as sure bets — get the weather right, pack a bunch of snacks, and we think you’ll likely have a good time. The other hikes are also great, but they might have some features that make them a bit more challenging or more particular in terms of when you need to visit to avoid the crowds.

### Find the best hike for your family

Apart from considering the time of the year and the weather (always important!), here are some questions that we think it can be useful to consider before planning a hike:

- How far do we want to drive?
- How much time do we have to hike?
- How much of a challenge are our children—and how much of a challenge are we—looking for?

Answering these questions can help you to locate trails nearer or farther; shorter or longer; and easier or more challenging in terms of the terrain and how much ascending the hike involves. Each trail includes the approximate driving distance from Knoxville (XXX - make sure to add when editing the tables), the length of the hike, and the elevation change for the hike. Check those out!

Lastly, if you’re looking for some inspiration, we have created top five lists for different features of trails in Chapter XX.
