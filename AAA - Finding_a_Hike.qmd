## Finding a Hike

You don't need to pick *the absolute best* trail for little ones to have a great time. Instead, you need one that works for your family!

In our experience, it can be really hard to predict when and where we’ll have a great time. 

Sometimes we have picked out a popular hike, but ended up disappointed by crowds and congested trails. Yet, at other times, we have picked out a trail near downtown Knoxville and a whim and have been delighted.

Thus, we think the hike is the where your family has the best experiences. Parents and caregivers know how this works in other places and at other times: kids receive a holiday gift, and they end up playing in the cardboard boxes. 

The same is true for hiking! The best family-friendly hike is the one where your family feels connected and creates lasting memories—whether it’s a scenic overlook or a creek where your kids throw rocks for hours.

That said, the hikes in this book are those on which we have had good experiences. We think those in this book offer great “bang for your buck”. While some of them are very popular, others are far less well-known. We selected the hikes that are in the sweet spot for parents of younger children: not too far away, not so challenging so as to be discouraging to kids and their parents; near amenities; and being scenic, appropriately challenging, and rewarding.

### Finding the best hike for your family

Some trails are short, flat, and on a paved surface. Others are longer, steeper, or rockier. How do you find which one is best for yoy?

This book is organized into the three regions we mentioned in the last chapter -- in and around Knoxville, the Cumberland Plateau, and the Great Smoky Mountains National park.

Within each section, we ordered the trails loosely along the lines of those we’d recommend first to friends looking for a pointer for where to go. Thus, the first few hikes in each section are what we think of as sure bets — get the weather right, pack a bunch of snacks, and we think you’ll likely have a good time. 

For example, Seven Islands in Knoxville is a reliable choice with paved paths, beautiful views, and plenty of spots for kids to explore. The other hikes are also great but may be more challenging or some care with respect to timing to avoid crowds. 

### Hiking one of the trails in this book

Each trail in this book includes an overview and the approximate driving distance from Knoxville, the length of the hike, and for which ages the hike is best. Check those out to find one that's best for you.

Additionally, the chapters include a trail description, directions to the trailhead. We also include a map of the trail, and a note about what’s nearby. The trails also include one or more "callouts" to scientific, historical, or other interesting information about the trail. Pick one or a few and head out!

If you’re looking for some inspiration, we have created top five lists for different features of trails in the Top 5 Hikes chapter (and the end of this book).

The trail maps should be pretty straightforward to use; the trailheads are marked with a green dot, and the trail is in red, with key features of the trail noted along the way. There are symbols for parking areas, restrooms, scenic overlooks, waterfalls, and other amenities, like playgrounds and picnic areas.

If you're ready and have a trail or two picked out, the next chapter details some considerations for your first hike.

### See you on the trails!

You're ready for your first hike.

We have a few other key details that are important, but are not essential for your first hike---additional gear, first aid kit essentials, and principles for being a good steward of the trails and outdoors. We've included those in the Appendix.
