## About this Book

### Why we wrote this book

When we moved to Knoxville with a three-month-old, we struggled to find our place in a new city. Our first trip to Ijams felt like a turning point, introducing us to Knoxville's incredible outdoor spaces. A camping trip to Frozen Head State Park opened our eyes: this place is special! Later, our first trip to the Smokies sealed the deal: we loved it here. As we transitioned from newcomers to those welcoming new friends, we were increasingly asked a question:

*Where should we go to hike?*

This book is meant to be our answer -- for our friends and for you. It's also a reflection of our love for the areas around Knoxville, where we have been lucky to have experiences as a family and with our friends that we cherish.

### Who this book is for

Well, are you looking for family-friendly hikes in or near Knoxville? Then this book is for you! We worked hard to be laser focused on that task. Several great books on hiking in Knoxville or its surroundings exist (we detail some of our favorites in Chapter XX). This book is for families and others caring for children who are looking for an accessible introduction to the outdoors that spares no excitement.

This book reflects our journey of hiking with children from infancy to early elementary school, and we’ve designed it to grow with your family. Thus, we are sensitive to how what counts as a family-friendly hike is likely different at different times -- and what we consider to be family-friendly differs (even between us as co-authors; cough cough, Josh!). For these reasons, we included a wide range of hikes, from those shorter than a mile on paved trails to epic expeditions into the Smokies. Additionally, we've noted trails that are stroller-friendly or accessible for families with additional needs.

We focus on the joy and challenges of hiking with little ones–from babies up through what we call "big kids", those who can confidently navigate terrain and lengthy hikes on their own.

### Where the hikes are

All of the hikes are near Knoxville, from just a few minutes to within an hour or two drive (but no longer). In accordance with our focus on hiking with younger children, most of the hikes are within an hour’s drive of Knoxville. We categorize the hikes into three regions:

-   **In and around Knoxville**: Hikes within the Knoxville city limits, to those within a 30-minute drive.
-   **The Cumberland Plateau**: An often under-appreciated but fantastic region of rock outcroppings and wild rivers to the West and North of Knoxville. The hikes in this book are from around one to two hours from Knoxville, with most being close to one hour.
-   **The Great Smoky Mountains National Park**: The most-visited and the most biodiverse national park—right in Knoxville’s backyard. These are mostly around an hour from Knoxville, though a few are closer to two hours.
