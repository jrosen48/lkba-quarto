## Considerations for Your First Hike

### You don't need fancy gear!

You might have the impression that you need fancy gear and lots of training to hike. Not so!

Our view is that you don’t need anything special to enjoy your first hike.
With the right trail and a few basics, you’ll be ready for an adventure.
Choose the right hike at the right time, and you may not need much gear at all.
We detail those considerations: selecting a particular hike at a particular time and a few other things that are needed on practically every hike.

### Define your own adventure

Do you need a hike that will help burn older kids' energy?
Or do you have toddlers who simply want to touch every leaf and rock you pass?
Decide what's most important for your family hike and pick a trail that best supports that!
For example, if you’re looking to burn energy, try a trail with some elevation.
On the other hand, for toddlers, a short, flat path with creeks or flowers can spark their curiosity.

### Let kids take the lead

To help your kids develop a love for hiking and the outdoors, let them take the lead.
Let them develop their own interests and explore their own curiosities when you go on a hike.
Sometimes this might mean playing in a creek for half of your planned hiking time.

### Plan for a mess

When a kiddo plods through a creek, it sure is nice to have a backup pair of socks and shoes!
Sometimes, a change of clothes packed in your bag or in your car can come in handy.
Pack a small bag (grocery bags can work!) for muddy clothes and wet or dirt shoes and a small towel for quick clean-ups

### Plan for the basics

Take a look at the weather for the area or region you're hiking, get a gauge on the terrain, and wear or pack appropriate clothes and shoes.

Here is a list of just the most basic items to consider bringing:

-   Water (often more than you think you'll need)!
-   A waist pack or backpack to put all of this in
-   This book or another map can be helpful; it's best to not count on having phone signal on most trails
-   Change of clothes---especially socks!---for wet trails
-   And don’t forget snacks—lots of snacks!

Kids may like to carry some of these!

In addition to the basics, there are of course some optional items to consider.
We've detailed these in Appendix XXX.

### Embrace serendipity

It's good to have a plan, but don't be surprised if something better comes along!
Maybe you hike further than you thought you would, or perhaps your child surprises you (and themselves!) by taking some time to rock hop across a creek, follow animal tracks, or look at plants and flowers. Be ready to follow your child’s lead—whether that means stopping to watch a butterfly or counting animal tracks.
These moments often become the most cherished.

### Select advice

We asked some local hiking experts to share some additional advice. Here's what they said:

- "Kids need to find things they love on hiking." - Finn (3)
- "Find rocks while hiking." - Ruth (5)
- "When possible, swim in the waterfalls." - Ruth (5)
- "It's important to go off the trail." - Ruth (5)
- "If your baby can walk a little bit, then let them walk." - Jonah (age 6)
- "Make sure to run and also look for bears." - Levi (7)
- "You might want to bring pants and a sweatshirt with a hood. Because that one time I brought no pants and a sweatshirt with no hood." - G.H. (9)

We have a few other key details that are important, but are not essential for your first hike---additional gear, first aid kit essentials, and principles for being a good steward of the trails and outdoors. We've included those in the Appendix. 

The next chapter offers some guidance on how to pick a trail (and how to use this book).
