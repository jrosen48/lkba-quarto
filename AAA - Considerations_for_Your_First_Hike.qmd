## Considerations for Your First Hike

You don’t need fancy gear to enjoy your first hike.
With the right trail and a few basics, you’ll be ready for an adventure.
Choose the right hike at the right time, and you may not need much gear at all.
We detail those considerations: selecting a particular hike at a particular time and a few other things that are needed on practically every hike.

### Define your own adventure

Do you need a hike that will help burn older kids' energy?
Or do you have toddlers who simply want to touch every leaf and rock you pass?
Decide what's most important for your family hike and pick a trail that best supports that!
For example, if you’re looking to burn energy, try a trail with some elevation.
For toddlers, a short, flat path with creeks or wildlife can spark their curiosity.

### Let kids take the lead

To help your kids develop a love for hiking and the outdoors, let them take the lead.
Let them develop their own interests and explore their own curiosities when you go on a hike.
Sometimes this might mean playing in a creek for half of your planned hiking time.

### Plan for a mess

When a kiddo plods through a creek, it sure is nice to have a backup pair of socks and shoes!
Sometimes, a change of clothes packed in your bag or in your car can come in handy.
Pack a small bag (grocery bags can work!) for muddy clothes and wet or dirt shoes and a small towel for quick clean-ups

### Plan for the basics

Take a look at the weather for the area or region you're hiking, get a gauge on the terrain, and wear or pack appropriate clothes and shoes.

Here is a list of just the most basic items to consider bringing:

- Water (often more than you think you'll need)!
- A waist pack or backpack to put all of this in 
- This book or another map can be helpful; it's best to not count on having phone signal on most trails
- Change of clothes---especially socks!---for wet trails
- And don’t forget snacks—lots of snacks!

Kids may like to carry some of these!

In addition to the basics, there are of course some optional items to consider.
We've detailed these in Appendix XXX.

### Embrace serendipity

It's good to have a plan, but don't be surprised if something better comes along!
Maybe you hike further than you thought you would, or perhaps your child surprises you (and themselves!) by taking some time to rock hop across a creek, follow animal tracks, or look at plants and flowers.

Be ready to follow your child’s lead—whether that means stopping to watch a butterfly or counting animal tracks.
These moments often become the most cherished.

You're ready for your first hike.
See you on the trails!
