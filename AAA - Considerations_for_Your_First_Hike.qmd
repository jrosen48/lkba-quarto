## Getting Ready for Your First Hike

### You don't need fancy gear!

There's a little secret in the hiking world.
You don't need a lot to get started.
Indeed, you may not need anything *new* at all.

Our view is that you don’t need anything special to enjoy your first hike.
With the right trail and a few basics, you’ll be ready for an adventure.

First, though, there's another little secret we need to share.

### You don't need to be an experienced hiker to hike with little ones

Hiking can be different from other physical activities in that it is not a competition.
Instead, it is about experiencing the outdoors in our own way.

This applies to beginners and to the most experienced hikers; a common saying shared among long-distance hikers is to *hike your own hike.* This means that each person hiking will hike in their way, and that there is not anything like a correct way to lace up your shoes and to get outdoors with your family.
If this applies to long-distance hikers, we think it doubly applies to families hiking with littles!

### Let kids take the lead

To help your kids develop a love for hiking and the outdoors, let them take the lead.
Let them develop their own interests and explore their own curiosities when you go on a hike.
Sometimes this might mean playing in a creek for half of your planned hiking time.

### Be choosy about the when and where

One of the benefits of living close to great hiking opportunities is that we can be a little choosy about when and where we hike.
While we are card carrying members of the puddle splashing club, we also appreciate that our littles may have a better time when it is not 50°F and rainy.
Does it look like it is going to rain all day, border on being too cold, or be oppressively hot?
You can choose another day to hike; we have enough good weather that we can avoid the less-than-ideal days.

### Plan for the essentials

At a minimum, the following items are essential for hikes when the weather is good and you are close to home:

-   Water
-   Snacks
-   A waist pack or backpack

Older kids may like to carry some of these---especially the snacks!

When taking on a lengthier hike or traveling farther from home, we like asking ourselves the following questions:

**What has the weather been?** *What is the weather forecast?* *Is it bug season?*

These can help you to pack appropriately.

The appendix has some recommendations for a basic first-aid kit as well as recommendations for some optional items you may wish to bring.

### Embrace serendipity

It's good to have a plan, but don't be surprised if something better comes along!
Maybe you hike further than you thought you would, or perhaps your child surprises you (and themselves!) by taking some time to rock hop across a creek, follow animal tracks, or look at plants and flowers.
Be ready to follow your child’s lead—whether that means stopping to watch a butterfly or counting animal tracks.
These moments often become the most cherished.

### Select advice

We asked some local hiking experts to share some additional advice.
Here's what they said:

-   "Kids need to find things they love on hiking." - Finn (3)
-   "Find rocks while hiking." - Ruth (5)
-   "When possible, swim in the waterfalls." - Ruth (5)
-   "It's important to go off the trail." - Ruth (5)
-   "If your baby can walk a little bit, then let them walk." - Jonah (age 6)
-   "Make sure to run and also look for bears." - Levi (7)
-   "You might want to bring pants and a sweatshirt with a hood. Because that one time I brought no pants and a sweatshirt with no hood." - G.H. (9)
-   "Games and stories are better when made up on the fly." - D. (9)

The next chapter offers some guidance on how to pick a trail (and how to use this book).
