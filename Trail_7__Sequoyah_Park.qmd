### Overview

Another gem among Knoxville city parks.
The trail starts at a large parking area near the restroom building and walks towards the river.
It follows the river past open fields, trees, and bushes that are practically impossible for kids not to explore.
The trail cuts up toward the greenway and hikes past Indian burial mounds and the old (many large) houses along the path before returning to the start.
In mild weather, it is a fantastic spot to hang up a hammock, go fish, have a picnic, or toss a frisbee or a football.
Good for kids of all walking ages; alternate ways to access the greenway make it easy to create a shorter loop.

### Directions to the Trailhead

| Trailhead Address         | Sequoyah Park Restrooms, W2HG+M9, Knoxville, TN 37919 |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Trailhead GPS Coordinates | 35.92932, -83.97398                                   |

The above address takes you to the restrooms that serve as a landmark for this sprawling park.
Please note that the address uses a "Plus" code that only works with Google Maps because the restrooms and trailhead don't have an assigned address.

Park in the large parking area and head toward the river and the large Elm tree with the steel wire around it.
The trail begins there along the river.
