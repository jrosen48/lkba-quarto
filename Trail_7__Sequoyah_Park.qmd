## Trail 7: Sequoyah Park

### Overview

This is another gem among Knoxville city parks, nestled in the heart of the the city in a neighborhood. The trail starts at a large parking area near the restroom building and walks towards the river. It follows the river past open fields, trees, and bushes which playfully beckon for kids not to explore! The trail cuts up toward the greenway and hikes past Indian burial mounds and the historic homes along the path before returning to the start. In mild weather, it is a fantastic spot to hang up a hammock, fish, have a picnic, or toss a frisbee or a football. This outing is ideal for kids of all walking ages, and alternate ways to access the greenway make it easy to create a shorter loop.
