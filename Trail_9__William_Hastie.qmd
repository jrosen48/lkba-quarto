## Trail 9: William Hastie

### Overview

You'll be surrounded by trees galore at William Hastie! The start features a beginner's mountain bike loop on a smooth path. Though short, this hike takes you by many spur trails; consider this a gentle introduction to a trail system close to but more rustic than Ijams. Good for all toddling and walking kids and their families.

#### Eastern Box Turtle

Think of the Eastern Box Turtle as a tiny explorer. These reptiles (animals whose body temperature that changes with its surroundings) are not *necessarily* found only near water. Instead, they move slowly across the forest floor searching for berries, mushrooms, and insects, making them easy to observe from a respectful distance. They're smaller in size than other turtles, with shells around 6" or fewer in length; the Snapping Turtle has a far larger shell.

The above address will direct you to a large, rarely-busy parking lot and a nice trailhead with a picnic area. Several trails start from this trailhead. Look for a sign for the Margaret Road Trail.

-   **Explore some of the many other trails while you're there.** William Hastie Natural Area features many other trails of varying difficulty. Consider taking Mitchie's Way from near the parking areaâ€”and then looping back to Margaret Road and the start on the trail of your choice.
