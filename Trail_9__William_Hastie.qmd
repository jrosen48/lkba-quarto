### Overview

A short walk on a gravel path through deep woods.
The start features a beginner's mountain bike loop on a smooth path; consider bringing kids' bikes.
Though short, this hike takes you by many spur trails; consider this a gentle introduction to a trail system close to but more rustic than Ijams.
Good for all toddling and walking kids and their families.
