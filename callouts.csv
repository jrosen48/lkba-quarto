Trail_19___Honey_Creek,"#### Rosebay Rhododendron

These plants are commonly seen on slopes near streams, which helps stabilize the soil. Looks similar to Mountain Laurel; has larger leaves. Pretty, but all parts of this plant are toxic to humans and pets!

Trail_3__Lakeshore_Park,"#### Appalachian Trail

Surprisingly, the crest of the Smokies (and the Appalachian Trail) are visible from this park. The Appalachian Trail is more than 2,100 miles long, beginning at Springer Mountain, Georgia, and ending at Mount Katahdin, in Maine. The longest section without a road crossing is in the Smokies – from Fontana Dam to Newfound Gap.\"
Trail_29__Andrews_Bald,"#### Fraser Fir  
You'll feel like you're in a different state or country when you spot these trees atop the Smokies – usually at elevations above 5,500 feet. Note the “Christmas tree smell”! Afflicted by the Balsam Wooly Adelgid and potentially a changing climate around the ridge of the Smokies, including Kuwohi, you’ll note both dead and diseased and healthy specimens. Recent evidence suggests that the Fraser Firs are healthier as a population than 20-30 years ago."
Trail_21__Little_River,"#### Eastern Hemlock

A tree that “feels” like the Smokies - likes shaded groves. Characterized by its needles being arranged in a flat frond. Threatened by an invasive species, the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid. While many trees in the region are affected (look for a white dusty covering of needles), others are not. Look for it along this trail."
Trail_15__Bandy_Creek,"#### Sandstone

The dominant rock on the Cumberland Plateau is sandstone—a relatively soft rock that erosion has easily sculpted. Over time, its wearing has carved cliffs, deep river valleys, and arches that characterize the Cumberland Plateau."
Trail_22__Mouse_Creek,"#### Blue Ridge Two-Lined Salamander

The Great Smoky Mountains has more than 30 species of salamanders – one of the types of species that contributes to and characterizes the incredible biodiversity of the Smokies. The Blue Ridge Two-Lined Salamander is among the most beautiful salamanders, with its yellow-to-orange coloring and stark black stripes.\

Trail_2__Ijams_Riverside,"#### Blue Phlox

Blue Phlox is a native wildflower that blooms in early to mid-spring. These plants provide an important source of early-season nectar for pollinators, like the swallowtail butterfly and other native moths. -MaryRose Weatherton"
Trail_1__Seven_Islands,"#### Paw Paw

A native fruit found around Seven Islands. Tastes like a mix of an apple and a banana. Paw Paw flowers are pollinated by beetles and flies."
Trail_1__Seven_Islands,"#### Eastern Bluebird

While many birds stop over at Seven Islands and areas like that on their migratory routes south (in the fall) and north (in the spring), the Eastern Bluebird is a year-round resident. Bluebirds are obligate cavity nesters - which is why they have experienced such a decline in their population as urban sprawl has increased. Refuges like Seven Islands give them lots of opportunities to find natural cavities to nest in! -MaryRose Weatherton"
Trail_24__Middle_Prong,"#### Brook Trout  
The native species of trout in Smokies streams. Speckled and small. Found at high elevations, whereas the Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout were later introduced for fishing."
Trail_18__Angel_Falls,"#### Angel Falls

Angel Falls is more a rapids than a waterfall, but there’s a history to its name: It was a waterfall until the 1940s, when it was dynamited to make the river more easily navigable by paddlers and boaters. It was only a little successful: the rapids are known as being impassable for all but the most intrepid whitewater paddlers."
Trail_12__House_Mountain,"#### Pine Trees

A family of conifers recognizable by their needles, which usually grow in bundles, and their seeds, which develop in stiff cones—making them distinct from hemlocks, spruces, and firs."
Trail_25__Abrams_Creek,"#### The Cherokee

The people of the Cherokee Nation were indigenous to a vast area to the south, east, and west of the Smokies; the Smokies were more a place for gathering and hunting than residing. The Eastern Band of the Cherokee remains an autonomous Nation just south of the Smokies."
Trail_4__High_Ground_Park,"#### Earthworks

Structures formed from shaping rocks and soil, often as part of forts around Knoxville constructed during the Civil War. Surprisingly long-standing. The earthworks here and at the nearby Fort Dickerson include ramparts – small hills or banks that served as defensive walls."
Trail_8__Ijams_Crag,"#### Tennessee Marble

Mead’s Quarry–near the parking area now filled with crystal clear water–was a quarry for pink-hued Tennessee Marble. This type of marble was used extensively in prominent buildings in the 1800s and early-mid 1900s, including the National Gallary of Art in Washington, D.C."
Trail_13__Emory_Falls,"#### Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary

A closed prison near Frozen Head State Park is full of lore due to its remote location. Part of the inspiration for the Barkley Marathons (you'll have to look it up). Now the site of a restaurant and distillery."
Trail_10__Sharp_s_Ridge,"#### Lichen

There are three primary types of lichens: Foliose (leaf-like in appearance), Crustose (crusty looking), and Fruiticose (coral-like and bushy). They are abundant in the region and are great bioindicators of air quality! -Amanda Garner"
Trail_23__Whiteoak_Sink,"#### Trillium  
Native perennial plants with distinctive three-petal flowers that bloom in the spring. These shade-loving plants are often found in the forest understory, where their seeds are dispersed and buried by ants, in a process called myrmecochory. Trillium plants are protected in many places because they are extremely slow-growing. For some species, it can take anywhere from 5-9 years from being planted to their first bloom; a single plant can live up to 25 years! So, next time you see one, make sure you appreciate their beauty with your eyes only.

Trail_7__Sequoyah_Park,"#### Elm Tree

 Trees characterized by an umbrella-shaped crown. The tree near the start of this hike (surrounded by a wire enclosure to prevent cars from being parked nearby) is known as a “Champion” of its kind – the largest Elm  in Knoxville."
Trail_7__Sequoyah_Park,"#### Native American Mounds

These earthen mounds are found in many places along the Mississippi River and its tributaries—like the Tennessee River. Nobody is completely sure why they were built, but some believe they served as gathering spots or markers to return to time and again. The mound here may date back as early as the 1400s, likely created by one of the Native Nations with ancestral ties to the Knoxville region."
Trail_28__Abrams_Falls,"#### The Black Bear

A symbol of the wildness of the Smokies -- and a very real presence. If you see one, admire their strength, beauty, and intelligence (from a distance!). Commonly seen in nearby Cades Cove."
Trail_30__Alum_Cave_Bluffs,"#### Jordans Red Cheek  
These iconic Smokies salamanders are found only in the Smokies! If you are above 2,500 ft, you might just see one of these amazing critters.  
- Amanda Garner"
Trail_30__Alum_Cave_Bluffs,"#### Red Spruce  
Similar to Fraser Fir, but larger (taller and wider) and found at lower elevations (beginning around 4,000 feet). Majestic. When you see them, you feel like you’re in high and remote mountains."
Trail_11__Norris_Dam,"#### Norris Dam

This was the first dam built by the Tennessee Valley Authority, stretching more than 1,800 feet wide and soaring 265 feet high. Behind it lies Norris Lake, a favorite for paddling and boating, while the Clinch River flows just below."
Trail_9__William_Hastie,"#### Eastern Box Turtle

Think of the Eastern Box Turtle as a tiny explorer. These reptiles (animals whose body temperature that changes with its surroundings) are not *necessarily* found only near water. Instead, they move slowly across the forest floor searching for berries, mushrooms, and insects, making them easy to observe from a respectful distance. They're smaller in size than other turtles, with shells around 6"" or fewer in length; the Snapping Turtle has a far larger shell."
Trail_27__Chestnut_Top,"#### Mountain Laurel

A large bush in the same family as Rhododendron and Blueberries - Heath plants. Beautiful flowers around early June. Can be distinguished from Rhododendron by its location: typically on ridges away from water."
Trail_14__Obed_Point,"#### Bigleaf Magnolia

This tree has the largest simple leaf of any North American tree—one single, undivided leaf! In the fall, its leaves scatter across the ground like pages from a newspaper. You’ll find it common on the Cumberland Plateau, though it’s rare in the Smokies."
Trail_6__Knox-Blount_Greenway,"#### Bald Eagle

Common along local rivers, including the river beside this hike---the Tennessee River. You may even spot a nesting pair on nearby Looney Island."
