Picture this: A sunny day in nature with your family. Your kids happily climb up and over rocks, stopping only splash in creeks. At the end, you have a picnic on the grass on a perfect, mild but warm day, without a bug to be found.

*Record Scratch*

Sure, we'd all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is almost always a bit messier and with unexpected bumps in the road.

If you're like us, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even leave from home. We've been there.

However, we've also grown as a family who hikes, honed in on the process, and adjusted our expectations. And sometimes the weather is just right, we and the kiddos are having a great time, and, every once in a while, there really isn't a bug in sight.

### We wrote this to help our friends (and you!)

After moving to Knoxville as a very young famiy in 2018, our first trip to Ijams introduced us to Knoxville's incredible outdoor spaces. A camping trip at Frozen Head opened our eyes. Later, visiting the Smokies sealed the deal: hiking helped us to feel connected and later to love where we live.

We don't think we're very special in this respect (and in most others!): One of the many joys of writing this book was discovering that we'd hiked all 30 of the trails in it.

As we transitioned from newcomers to becoming established, we were increasingly asked questions by our friends:

*Where should we hike with our kids?*

and

*What do I need to hike with our kids?*

This book is meant to answer those questions. But, as a sneak preview, we picked out 30 trails with an eye not only toward the trails that are scenic and exciting, but also those that are likely to balance driving distance, crowds, and kid-friendly characteristics. And, one of the many great parts about hiking is that you don't need much to get started. Indeed, you may not need anything at all.

### Who this book is for

This book is for families and others caring for children who are looking for an accessible introduction to getting started hiking around Knoxville. Furthermore, this book is also for those who with a few favorite trails looking to do and learn more---find longer, more challenging hikes, or be introduced to hidden gems.

Because this book is for those new to hiking and those with some mud on their shoes, we've included a wide range of hikes, from those shorter than a mile on paved trails to epic expeditions into the Smokies. Additionally, we've noted trails that are stroller-friendly or accessible for families with additional needs.

### Where the hikes are

All of the hikes are near Knoxville---from just a few minutes to within an hour or two drive (but no longer). Following our focus on hiking with younger children, most of the hikes are within an hour’s drive of Knoxville.

They are in three regions:

-   **In and around Knoxville**: Hikes within the Knoxville city limits, to those within a 30-minute drive.
-   **The Cumberland Plateau**: An often under-appreciated but fantastic region of rock outcroppings and wild rivers to the West and North of Knoxville. The hikes in this book are from around one to two hours from Knoxville, with most being close to one hour.
-   **The Great Smoky Mountains National Park**: The most-visited and the most biodiverse national park—right in Knoxville’s backyard. These are mostly around an hour from Knoxville, though a few are closer to two hours.
