Picture this: A sunny day in nature with your family. Your kids happily throw rocks in rivers and wade in creeks. Oh, lookâ€”JoJo caught a crawdad! You enjoy a peaceful picnic with no complaints about the peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread.

*Record Scratch*

Sure, we'd all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is a bit messier, potentially whinier (which comes with the territory when doing activities with young kids), and comes with unexpected bumps in the road.

In reality, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even leave your house. Packing for a day hike seems like it should be simple, but by the time you consider what your family will need, you've already expended a lot of mental energy and can't muster up the patience for the car ride to the trailhead.

Once you arrive, the kids are hungry for the forty-third time, the baby falls and scrapes her knee and refuses to go in the carrier pack, and your oldest can't be pulled away from the creek at the beginning of the hike!

We've been there more times than we can count, and have felt more relief in a hike being over than we felt excitement to go on the hike in the first place. However, we've also grown as a family who hikes, honed in on the process, adjusted our expectations, and have built some beautiful memories in the process.
