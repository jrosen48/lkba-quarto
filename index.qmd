Picture this: A sunny day in nature with your family. Your kids happily throw rocks in rivers and wade in creeks. Oh, look—JoJo caught a crawdad! You enjoy a peaceful picnic with no complaints about the peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread.

*Record Scratch*

Sure, we'd all love for the above vision to be reality, but the truth is a bit messier, potentially whinier (which comes with the territory when doing activities with young kids), and comes with unexpected bumps in the road.

In reality, you might be ready to throw in the towel before you even leave your house. Packing for a day hike seems like it should be simple, but by the time you consider what your family will need, you've already expended a lot of mental energy and can't muster up the patience for the car ride to the trailhead.

Once you arrive, the kids are hungry for the forty-third time, the baby falls and scrapes her knee and refuses to go in the carrier pack, and your oldest can't be pulled away from the creek at the beginning of the hike!

We've been there more times than we can count, and have felt more relief in a hike being over than we felt excitement to go on the hike in the first place. However, we've also grown as a family who hikes, honed in on the process, adjusted our expectations, and have built some beautiful memories in the process.

If you're a family who enjoys the outdoors, wants to enjoy the outdoors, and wants to learn more about the hiking, read on!

### Why we wrote this book

When we moved to Knoxville with a three-month-old, we struggled to find our place in a new city. Our first trip to Ijams felt like a turning point, introducing us to Knoxville's incredible outdoor spaces. A camping trip to Frozen Head State Park opened our eyes: this place is special! Later, our first trip to the Smokies sealed the deal: we loved it here. 

Hiking can be a way to get to know a place, each other, and oneself. It doesn't have to cost much (or anything!). And it can be fun.

As we transitioned from newcomers to those welcoming new friends, we were increasingly asked a question:

*Where should we go to hike?*

This book is meant to be our answer -- for our friends and for you!

This book reflects our journey of hiking with children from infancy to early elementary school, and we’ve designed it to grow with your family. 

Thus, we are sensitive to how what counts as a family-friendly hike is likely different at different times -- and what we consider to be family-friendly differs (even between us as co-authors; cough cough, Josh!).

### Who this book is for

We worked hard to be laser focused on that task. Several great books on hiking in Knoxville or its surroundings exist (we detail some of our favorites in Chapter XX). This book is for families and others caring for children who are looking for an accessible introduction to the outdoors that spares no excitement.

For these reasons, we included a wide range of hikes, from those shorter than a mile on paved trails to epic expeditions into the Smokies. Additionally, we've noted trails that are stroller-friendly or accessible for families with additional needs.

We focus on the joy and challenges of hiking with little ones–from babies up through what we call "big kids", those who can confidently navigate terrain and lengthy hikes on their own.

### Where the hikes are

All of the hikes are near Knoxville, from just a few minutes to within an hour or two drive (but no longer). In accordance with our focus on hiking with younger children, most of the hikes are within an hour’s drive of Knoxville. We categorize the hikes into three regions:

-   **In and around Knoxville**: Hikes within the Knoxville city limits, to those within a 30-minute drive.
-   **The Cumberland Plateau**: An often under-appreciated but fantastic region of rock outcroppings and wild rivers to the West and North of Knoxville. The hikes in this book are from around one to two hours from Knoxville, with most being close to one hour.
-   **The Great Smoky Mountains National Park**: The most-visited and the most biodiverse national park—right in Knoxville’s backyard. These are mostly around an hour from Knoxville, though a few are closer to two hours.

In the next chapter, we'll provide some pointers on how to prepare for your first hike.
