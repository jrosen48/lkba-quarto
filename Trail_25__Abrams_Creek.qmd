### Overview

Abrams Creek is a great place to start hiking in the Smokies if you live in or around Knoxville. It's accessible, offers a wide variety of features to please all members of the family, and has the added bonus of being beautiful! The enduring memory from this trail is of kids splashing endlessly in the shallow creeks. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies, and we returned again and again because we always enjoyed our time together there. There are many ways to shorten the hike, and we often hike around a mile in and then turn around. It can be warmer here in the summer months, but the river offers many opportunities to swim and splash around, making it a great destination for the summer as well. This hike is relatively challenging and better suited to hiking with older children, but the beauty of this hike is its versatility.

### Directions to the Trailhead

| Trailhead Address         | Abrams Creek Campground, J368+MR Tallassee, Tennessee |
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| Trailhead GPS Coordinates | 35.61095, -83.93356                                   |

It never seems to become crowded at Abrams Creek, but parking can be a bit confusing. This is because the campground is further along the same road the trailhead is on. Also, there are two areas to park for the trailhead. We usually park by the gate to the campground, but you can also park near the large sign with maps of this area of the national park.

-   Camping at Abrams Creek Campground. This is a lovely creekside campground that you pass on this hike. Consider a stay in the summer, when jumping in the cool, not-too-deep creek can be a respite from the heat---or in the fall when this area pops with fall colors.
