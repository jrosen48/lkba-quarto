## Trail 28: Abrams Falls

### Overview

This is a classic Smokies hike along the scenic Abrams Creek, ending in an epic waterfall. The only downside? You must drive (or, on many Wednesdays in the summer, bike!) through Cades Cove to get to the trailhead, and Cades Cove is often busy. We recommend either being prepared for extensive traffic in Cades Cove or visiting during the week or outside of the busy warm weather weekends. With that caveat in mind, we recommend this as a true day-long family adventure worthy of a visit. The trail starts at a scenic trailhead near the intersection of two pretty creeks. it hikes through the piney forest, climbing a little at a few points. Abrams Falls is a wonderful spot for a lengthy picnic before returning to the start. Best for older children or younger children who are carried when their little legs get tired.

#### The Black Bear

A symbol of the wildness of the Smokies, and a very real presence. If you see one, admire their strength, beauty, and intelligence (from a distance!). Commonly seen in nearby Cades Cove.

Navigate to this parking area at the end of a short gravel road connected to the Cades Cove Loop Rd. Lots of parking. Look for a sign pointing toward the Abrams Falls Trail and Abrams Fall.

| 2.2                 | Small hill beside and atop Abrams Falls. Take the trail briefly, steeply down to the bottom of the waterfall.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2.5                 | Reach the base of the waterfall. There are many spots to stop and snack or picnic. Take care to watch from a distance and not swim in the pool of the falls here; the undertone is dangerous. After a break, turn around to begin the back portion of this out-and-back hike. |

### Nearby

-   **Visit the Visitor Center.** The Cades Cove Visitor Center (5686 Cades Cove Loop Rd, Townsend, TN 37882) up the road is a store, but it also abuts several nearby historical structures that are worth a visit: the Cades Cove Historical Grist Mill and the John P Cable Drive Thru Barn (that you walk across, rather than drive through!). Try to find your way to Mill Creek to cool off in warm weather.
-   **Stop at historic cabins and scenic lookouts.** Though it can be busy with traffic, especially during peak visitation periods (summer and fall weekends, in particular), a drive through Cades Cove is punctuated with numerous opportunities to stop at historic cabins and scenic lookouts. Plus, much of the year, you and others will stop to see wildlife such as deer, turkey, and often bears!
-   **Bike the Cades Cove Loop.** Biking the Cades Cove Loop on car-free Wednesdays during the summer and into the early fall is a classic Smokies activity. We know it's a lot for kids to bike (or be carried out on a bike) and to hike, so this may be best as a separate day trip.
