## Trail 28: Abrams Falls

### Overview

This is a classic Smokies hike along the scenic Abrams Creek, ending in an epic waterfall. The only downside? You must drive (or, on Wednesdays in the summer, bike!) through Cades Cove to get to the trailhead, and Cades Cove is often busy. We recommend either being prepared for extensive traffic in Cades Cove or visiting during the week or outside of the busy warm weather weekends. With that caveat in mind, we recommend this as a true day-long family adventure worthy of a visit. The trail starts at a scenic trailhead near the intersection of two pretty creeks. it hikes through the piney forest, climbing a little at a few points. Abrams Falls is a wonderful spot for a lengthy picnic before returning to the start. Best for older children or younger children who are carried when their little legs get tired.

### Nearby

-   Visiting the visitor center. The Cades Cove Visitor Center (5686 Cades Cove Loop Rd, Townsend, TN 37882) up the road is a store, but it also abuts several nearby historical structures that are worth a visit)---the Cades Cove Historical Grist Mill and the John P Cable Drive Thru Barn (that you walk, rather than drive, to and through!). Try to find your way to Mill Creek to cool off in warm weather.
-   Stopping at historic cabins and scenic lookouts. Though it can be busy with traffic, especially during peak visitation periods (summer and fall weekends, in particular), a drive through Cades Cove is punctuated with numerous opportunities to stop at historic cabins and scenic lookouts. Plus, much of the year, you and others will stop to see wildlife---deer, turkey, and often bears!
-   Bike the Cades Cove Loop. Biking the Cades Cove Loop on car-free Wednesdays during the summer and into the early fall is a classic Smokies activity. We know it's a lot for kids to bike (or be carried out on a bike) and to hike, so this may be best as a separate day trip.
