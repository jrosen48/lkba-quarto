## Trail 27: Chestnut Top

### Overview

Steep but quiet and rewarding, Chestnut Top is a fun choice for a shorter hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This hike is one of the closest to Knoxville. Furthermore, it is close to the amenities of Townsend --- a far quieter town than Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. The trail starts with a steep climb until it reaches a rocky point that is a great stopping point; we always grab a snack here, and kiddos like to hike on or around the rocks. The trail continues along the trail past pretty mountain laurel, typically in bloom around mid-May through early June, stopping at a fun but somewhat arbitrary point - a hollow tree! Continue farther if you like, or head back to the start and the Townsend Wye, a great picnic and water play spot. Best for kids who are comfortable with a steady climb.

### Nearby

-   Visiting Townsend. Townsend rightly contrasts itself with busy Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg---it remains quiet but full of places to stop. We love the kid-friendly Peaceful Side Social (7967 E Lamar Alexander Pkwy, Townsend, TN 37882) and the next-door Peaceful Side Creamery.
-   Swimming at the Townsend Wye. This is a classic summertime Smokies activity. From the large parking area near the trailhead, swim in the Little River beside the Townsend Wye---the three-way intersection of Townsend Entrance Road (toward Townsend), Laurel Creek Road (to Cades Cove), and Little River Gorge Road (toward Gatlinburg).
