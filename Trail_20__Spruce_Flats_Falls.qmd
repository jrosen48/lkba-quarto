## Trail 20: Spruce Flats Falls

### Overview

An adventurous hike in the Smokies accessible to many families, this hike is also a great introduction to the national park, particularly when visiting from around Knoxville (it's fairly close). It's on the Great Smoky Mountains Institute site at Tremont, a national leader in outdoors and environmental education. It is the first hike in this section for a good reason. The proximity to Townsend is a bonus. Best for little kids and big kids. We have hiked this trail with a two-month-old baby in wrap carrier! Just take your time and watch your footing. This, at times, challenging hike is well worth it!

### Directions to the Trailhead

Trailhead Address: 9275 Tremont Rd, Townsend, TN 37882

Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 35.64000, -83.68905

The address and coordinates are for the Great Smoky Mountains Institute, as this is the easiest-to-locate destination. When nearly there (less than a quarter of a mile from the destination), you'll cross a bridge to enter the Institute. You'll see a lot of parking around, as well as a gift shop. Though the trailhead and Google Maps will navigate you a little further, the parking you see here is the best place to park. From this parking lot, walk up the road a little toward the Spruce Flats Falls Trailhead to start the hike.

| 0.0                 | Though the main trail you take to the falls is the Buckeye Trail, you will start the hike on the Lumber Ridge Trail. Ample signage is available to help avoid confusion. |
| 0.1                 | Turn right onto the Buckeye Trail.                                                                                                                                       |
| 0.15                | Trail levels out before a steep climb.                                                                                                                                   |
| 0.3                 | Climb begins. It's a (good) challenge!                                                                                                                                   |
| 0.5                 | High point of the hike in a piney outcropping. Good photo spot. Begin to wind down toward the waterfall.                                                                 |
| 0.8                 | Spruce Flat Falls. A great snack or picnic spot. After a nice break, turn around the way you came.                                                                       |
