### Overview

An adventurous hike in the Smokies accessible to many families, it is also a great introduction to the Smokies, particularly when visiting from around Knoxville (it's fairly close).
It's on the Great Smoky Mountains Institute site at Tremont, a national leader in outdoors and environmental education.
It is the first hike in this section for a good reason.
The proximity to Townsend is a bonus.
Best for little kids and big kids.

| 0.0                 | You'll see signs for Spruce Flats Falls, but you'll begin ever-so-briefly on a different trail that connects to the trail you'll take to the falls, Buckeye Trail. Start on the Lumber Ridge Trail. |
| 0.1                 | Turn right onto the Buckete Trail, the trail you'll be on all the way to the falls (and back to this spot on the return journey).                                                                   |

| 0.5                 | High point of the hike in a piney outcropping. Good photo spot. Begin to wind down toward the waterfall.                                                                                            |
| 0.8                 | Spruce Flat Falls. A great snack or picnic spot. After a nice break, turn around the way you came.                                                                                                  |
