## Trail 20: Spruce Flats Falls

### Overview

An adventurous hike in the Smokies accessible to many families, it is also a great introduction to the Smokies, particularly when visiting from around Knoxville (it's fairly close). It's on the Great Smoky Mountains Institute site at Tremont, a national leader in outdoors and environmental education. It is the first hike in this section for a good reason. The proximity to Townsend is a bonus. Best for little kids and big kids.

### Directions to the Trailhead

Trailhead Address: 9275 Tremont Rd, Townsend, TN 37882 Trailhead GPS Coordinates: 35.64000, -83.68905

The address and coordinates are for the Great Smoky Mountains Institute, as this is the easiest-to-locate destination. When nearly there (less than a quarter of a mile from the destination), you'll cross a bridge to enter the Institute. You'll see a lot of parking around --- and the gift shop. Though the trailhead and Google Maps will navigate you a little further, the parking you see here is the best place to park. From this parking lot, walk up the road a little toward the Spruce Flats Falls Trailhead to start the hike.

|:----------|:-----------------------------------|
| 0.0                 | You'll see signs for Spruce Flats Falls, but you'll begin ever-so-briefly on a different trail that connects to the trail you'll take to the falls, Buckeye Trail. Start on the Lumber Ridge Trail. |
| 0.1                 | Turn right onto the Buckete Trail, the trail you'll be on all the way to the falls (and back to this spot on the return journey).                                                                   |
| 0.15                | Trail levels out before a steep cluimb.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 0.3                 | Climb begins. It's a (good) challenge!                                                                                                                                                              |
| 0.5                 | High point of the hike in a piney outcropping. Good photo spot. Begin to wind down toward the waterfall.                                                                                            |
| 0.8                 | Spruce Flat Falls. A great snack or picnic spot. After a nice break, turn around the way you came.                                                                                                  |
