## Trail 19 : Honey Creek

### Overview

Unreal! This trail features rope ladders, wooden ladders, gigantic sandstone walls, a scenic overlook, a trail that traverses *up* a river, and boulders you crawl over and through. It's spectacular and challenging. A memorable trail that exemplifies what makes the Cumberland Plateau region such a worthy complement to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Younger children may be able to hike the first half (traveling counterclockwise from the trailhead); you can walk the road back to the trailhead. The second half of the trail contains more challenging (but very beautiful) sections. Still, it's hard --- probably the most difficult for most in this book.

| 1.75                | Trail turns up into Honey Creek. This is the wildest (and most fun) section of the trail.

| 2.75                | Wind through and around huge boulders and rocks. Continue to look for the green trail symbols---you're almost out of the chaotic section!                                                                                                                                          |
