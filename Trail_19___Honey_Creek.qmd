### Overview

Unreal!
This trail features rope ladders, wooden ladders, gigantic sandstone walls, a scenic overlook, a trail that traverses *up* a river, and boulders you crawl over and through.
It's spectacular and challenging.
A memorable trail that exemplifies what makes the Cumberland Plateau region such a worthy complement to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Younger children may be able to hike the first half (traveling counterclockwise from the trailhead); you can walk the road back to the trailhead.
The second half of the trail contains more challenging (but very beautiful) sections.
Still, it's hard --- probably the most difficult for most in this book.

Turn left at the trail juncture to head down toward the Big South Fork.                                           |
| 1.75                | Trail turns up into Honey Creek. This is the wildest (and most fun) section of the trail.

| 2.25                | Head up and away from the creek.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2.75                | Wind through and around huge boulders and rocks.
