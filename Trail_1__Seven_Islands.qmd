## Trail 1: Seven Islands

### Overview

This is one of our favorite trails in this book, and it is the first trail for that reason! This hike is a crowd pleaser for every family member of all ages thanks to a paved path that makes bringing babies in a stroller a breeze and easy acces to experience meadow, woodland, and a river! For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a meadow. Look for varied bird varieties and deer in all seasons! The trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and then a dirt trail make a loop around a beautiful island before returning back to the paved path. This hike is great for all ages and seasons, though it is sometimes hot in the summer due to limited shade on the paved part of the trail.

The Kelly name is highly visible at Seven Islands, but a more recent owner of this land, the Clausens, prompted the formation of this state park when a planned entertainment development across the river concerned them that this precious area would be over-developed.
