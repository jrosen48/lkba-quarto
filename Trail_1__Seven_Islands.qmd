## Trail 1: Seven Islands

### Overview

This is one of our favorite trails in this book, and it is the first trail for that reason! This hike is a crowd pleaser for every family member of all ages thanks to a paved path that makes bringing babies in a stroller a breeze and easy acces to experience meadow, woodland, and a river! For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a meadow. Look for varied bird varieties and deer in all seasons! The trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and then a dirt trail make a loop around a beautiful island before returning back to the paved path. This hike is great for all ages and seasons, though it is sometimes hot in the summer due to limited shade on the paved part of the trail.

#### Eastern Bluebird

While many birds stop over at Seven Islands and areas like that on their migratory routes south (in the fall) and north (in the spring), the Eastern Bluebird is a year-round resident. Bluebirds are obligate cavity nesters - which is why they have experienced such a decline in their population as urban sprawl has increased. Refuges like Seven Islands give them lots of opportunities to find natural cavities to nest in! -MaryRose Weatherton
