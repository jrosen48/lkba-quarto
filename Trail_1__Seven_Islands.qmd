### Overview

This is one of our favorite trails in this book—it is the first trail for that reason.
Even though it is relatively close to Knoxville, it is simply a fantastic place to hike.
For the trail we highlight, a paved path descends through a meadow.
Look for birds and deer!
The trail crosses a bridge over the French Broad River and hike around a beautiful island (look for side trails and the native paw paw fruit in the fall!) before returning to the start—or pick one of the many other nearby trails in the park.
Great for all ages and seasons, though sometimes hot in the summer due to limited shade on the paved part of the trail.

| 2                   | Climb back up past the meadows. This is the toughest part of the hike (but, it shouldn't be too steep, and the trailhead is near!).            |

### Nearby

-   Hiking other trails. Hike up the Hickory Ridge trail, another trail at Seven Islands State Birding Park that is accessible from just behind the bathrooms near the parking lot. There are several other great hikes available, including hikes down the Kelly Lane Greenway (the other, wider, paved path near the barn that is gated to prevent cars from driving on it) and the Upland Inner and Outer Trail Loops.
-   Enjoying watersports. Consider kayaking, canoeing, or paddleboarding, especially on warm days. There is a great place to put in, Seven Islands Landing and Boat Ramp (2809 Kelly Ln, Kodak, TN 37764). Also, River Sports Outfitters rents kayaks and canoes here during the summer (see <https://www.riversportsoutfitters.com/>).\
-   Stopping for a bite to eat and a drink on the way back. On the way home, consider stopping by kid-friendly Walnut Springs Winery (1175 Midway Rd, Knoxville, TN 37914), open Wednesday-Sunday as of this writing.
